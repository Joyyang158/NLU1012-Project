There were no stock options granted in 2019 or 2018. The total grant date fair value of stock options that vested during 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $2.8 million, $10.1 million and $20.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options was $0.3 million, which the Company expects to recognize over an estimated weighted average period of 0.2 years. As of December 31, 2019, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $94.2 million, which the Company expects to recognize over an estimated weighted average period of 1.9 years. As of December 31, 2019, there was zero unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested warrants.\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. The fair value of RSUs without market conditions is the fair value of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock on the grant date. The fair value of RSUs with market conditions is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. In determining the fair value of the stock options, warrants and the equity awards issued under the 2015 ESPP, the Company used the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment.\nFair Value of Common Stock\u2014The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying stock options had historically been established by the Company\u2019s board of directors. Following the completion of the IPO, the Company began using the market closing price for the Company\u2019s Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.\nExpected Term\u2014The Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time stock-based awards have been exercisable. As a result, for stock options, the Company used the simplified method to calculate the expected term, which is equal to the average of the stock-based award\u2019s weighted average vesting period and its contractual term. The expected term of the 2015 ESPP was based on the contractual term.\nVolatility\u2014The Company estimates the expected volatility of the common stock underlying its stock options at the grant date. Prior to 2018, the Company estimated the expected volatility of the common stock underlying stock options, warrants and equity awards issued under its 2015 ESPP at the grant date by taking the average historical volatility of the common stock of a group of comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected life. The Company used this method because it had limited information on the volatility of its Class A common stock because of its short trading history. Beginning in 2018, the Company used a combination of historical volatility from its Class A common stock along with historical volatility from the group of comparable publicly traded companies.\nRisk-Free Rate\u2014The risk-free interest rate is estimated average interest rate based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon notes with terms consistent with the expected term of the awards.\nDividend Yield\u2014The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends and does not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, it used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the stock-based awards represent management judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The fair value of the stock option awards, warrants, awards issued under the 2015 ESPP, and awards granted to employees was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of the RSUs with market conditions were estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model combined with a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of these awards were estimated using the following Black-Scholes assumptions:\nQuestion:\nWhat model is used to estimate the fair value of RSUs with market conditions?", "output": "Monte Carlo simulation model", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the model used to estimate the fair value of RSUs with market conditions is a Monte Carlo simulation model."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

The key performance indicators that we monitor are as follows:\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA and revenue constant currency growth rate are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and revenue constant currency growth rate to the nearest comparable GAAP measures, see Item 6. \u201cSelected Financial Data.\u201d (2) Reflects the customer count on the last day of the period rounded to the nearest hundred customers.\nRevenue constant currency growth rate. We believe revenue constant currency growth rate is a key indicator of our operating results. We calculate revenue constant currency growth rate by translating revenue from entities reporting in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars using the comparable foreign currency exchange rates from the prior fiscal periods.\nFor further explanation of the uses and limitations of this non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation of our revenue constant currency growth rate to revenue, as reported, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, see Item 6. \u201cSelected Financial Data.\u201d As our total revenue grew over the past three years, our revenue constant currency growth rate has decreased over the same period, as the incremental growth from period to period represented a smaller percentage of total revenue as compared to the prior period.\nAs our total revenue grows, we expect our constant currency growth rate will decline as the incremental growth from period to period is expected to represent a smaller percentage of total revenue as compared to the prior period.\nRevenue retention rate. We believe that our ability to retain customers is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. Our revenue retention rate is driven by our customer renewals and upsells. We calculate our revenue retention rate by annualizing constant currency revenue recorded on the last day of the measurement period for only those customers in place throughout the entire measurement period.\nWe include add-on, or upsell, revenue from additional employees and services purchased by existing customers. We divide the result by revenue on a constant currency basis on the first day of the measurement period for all customers in place at the beginning of the measurement period. The measurement period is the trailing twelve months.\nThe revenue on a constant currency basis is based on the average exchange rates in effect during the respective period. Our revenue retention rate in fiscal 2019 was relatively consistent with fiscal 2018. We expect our revenue retention rate to remain relatively consistent for fiscal 2020.\nTotal customers. We believe the total number of customers is a key indicator of our financial success and future revenue potential. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription contract as of the measurement date. A customer is typically a parent company or, in a few cases, a significant subsidiary that works with us directly. We expect to continue to grow our customer base through the addition of new customers in each of our markets.\nGross profit percentage. Gross profit percentage is calculated as gross profit divided by revenue. Our gross profit percentage has been relatively consistent over the past three years; however, it has fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to timing of the addition of hardware and employees to serve our growing customer base. More recently, gross profit has also included amortization of intangible assets related to acquired businesses.\nWe provide our services in each of the regions in which we operate. Costs related to supporting and hosting our product offerings and delivering our services are incurred in the region in which the related revenue is recognized. As a result, our gross profit percentage in actual terms is consistent with gross profit on a constant currency basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a key indicator of our operating results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income, adjusted to exclude: depreciation, amortization, disposals and impairment of long-lived assets, acquisition-related gains and expenses, litigation-related expenses, share-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, interest income and interest expense, the provision for income taxes and foreign exchange income (expense).\nAdjusted EBITDA also includes rent paid in the period related to locations that are accounted for as build-to-suit facilities. For further explanation of the uses and limitations of this non-GAAP measure and a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, net (loss) income, see Item 6. \u201cSelected Financial Data.\u201d\nWe expect that our Adjusted EBITDA will continue to increase; however, we expect that our operating expenses will also increase in absolute dollars as we focus on expanding our sales and marketing teams and growing our research and development capabilities.\nQuestion:\nIn which year was Adjusted EBITDA less than 20,000 thousands?", "output": "Because locate and analyze Adjusted EBITDA in row 8, the answer is: 2017.", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, Adjusted EBITDA was less than $20,000 in the year 2017.

The $7.0 million was largely related to the Company's closure of its manufacturing facility in Fremont, California, and the partial closure of its Livingston, Scotland facility. The $5.2 million was related to accelerated share-based compensation expense recorded pursuant to the retirement agreement with the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. During fiscal 2015 the Company recorded $1.7 million of restructuring costs, largely related to the Company's consolidation of its manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin, as well as its relocation of manufacturing operations from Juarez, Mexico to Guadalajara, Mexico.\n(5) The Company defines return on invested capital (\"ROIC\"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as tax-effected operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents, as discussed in Part II, Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Return on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\") and Economic Return.\" For a reconciliation of ROIC and Economic Return to our financial statements that were prepared in accordance with GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K.\n(6) Fiscal 2015 included 53 weeks.

Financing Receivables and Operating Leases\n(a) Financing Receivables\nFinancing receivables primarily consist of lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases resulting from the sale of Cisco\u2019s and complementary third-party products and are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average. Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and services, which may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Loan receivables have terms of three years on average. Financed service contracts include financing receivables related to technical support and advanced services. Revenue related to the technical support services is typically deferred and included in deferred service revenue and is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed, which typically ranges from one to three years.\nA summary of our financing receivables is presented as follows (in millions):\nQuestion:\nWhat was the difference in the net total between Lease and Loan Receivables?", "output": "5367-2326 = 3041", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, the difference in the net total between Lease and Loan Receivables is:  Lease Receivables: $2,367 + $142 = $2,509 Loan Receivables: $5,438 + $9 = $5,447  Therefore, the difference in the net total between Lease and Loan Receivables is $2,509 - $5,447 = $2,938."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

The chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources on a segment basis. The Company\u2019s operating segments consist of two segments \u2013 EMS and DMS, which are also the Company\u2019s reportable segments. The segments are organized based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles.\nThe EMS segment is focused around leveraging IT, supply chain design and engineering, technologies largely centered on core electronics, utilizing the Company\u2019s large scale manufacturing infrastructure and the ability to serve a broad range of end markets. The EMS segment is a high volume business that produces products at a quicker rate (i.e. cycle time) and in larger quantities and includes customers primarily in the automotive and transportation, capital equipment, cloud, computing and storage, defense and aerospace, industrial and energy, networking and telecommunications, print and retail, and smart home and appliances industries.\nThe DMS segment is focused on providing engineering solutions, with an emphasis on material sciences, technologies and healthcare. The DMS segment includes customers primarily in the edge devices and accessories, healthcare, mobility and packaging industries.\nNet revenue for the operating segments is attributed to the segment in which the service is performed. An operating segment\u2019s performance is evaluated based on its pre-tax operating contribution, or segment income. Segment income is defined as net revenue less cost of revenue, segment selling, general and administrative expenses, segment research and development expenses and an allocation of corporate manufacturing expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment income does not include amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation expense and related charges, restructuring and related charges, distressed customer charges, acquisition and integration charges, loss on disposal of subsidiaries, settlement of receivables and related charges, impairment of notes receivable and related charges, restructuring of securities loss, goodwill impairment charges, business interruption and impairment charges, net, income (loss) from discontinued operations, gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations, other expense, interest income, interest expense, income tax expense or adjustment for net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nTotal segment assets are defined as accounts receivable, inventories, net, customer-related property, plant and equipment, intangible assets net of accumulated amortization and goodwill. All other non-segment assets are reviewed on a global basis by management. Transactions between operating segments are generally recorded at amounts that approximate those at which we would transact with third parties.\nThe following tables set forth operating segment information (in thousands):\nQuestion:\nHow many assets in 2019 exceeded $4,000,000 thousand?", "output": "Objects satisfying the requirements:\nEMS\nDMS\nAs a result, the answer is 2", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "count", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can answer the question as follows:  In 2019, the following assets exceeded $4,000,000:  * EMS: $4,353,465 * DMS: $4,988,198  Therefore, there were two assets in 2019 that exceeded $4,000,000."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.

The Company\u2019s controlling interest in Eure-et-Loir is 51% with local partners holding a 49% noncontrolling interest. The agreement provides the local partners with put options, which allow them to sell outstanding shares of Eure-et-Loir to the Company, and the Company with call options, which allow it to buy the noncontrolling shares of Eure-et-Loir. The put options, which are not under the Company\u2019s control, cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interests.

Central Overheads are still expected to be approximately $150 million on an annual basis before taking into account any impact from the Endeavour Group transaction.\nA small increase in inventory to $4,280 million was primarily due to higher closing inventory in New Zealand and BIG W to improve availability.

Additions of fixed assets of $2,040 million during the year mainly related to store refurbishments, supply chain and IT infrastructure and included $203 million related to property development activity. This was partially offset by depreciation and amortisation, disposals and an impairment of $166 million associated with the BIG W network review.\nNet assets held for sale of $225 million decreased by $575 million mainly as a result of the sale of the Petrol business to EG Group on 1 April 2019.\nIntangible assets of $6,526 million increased by $61 million driven by an increase in goodwill and brand names in New Zealand due to the strengthening of the New Zealand dollar, a minor increase in goodwill associated with the acquisition of businesses partially offset by an impairment to the carrying value of Summergate of $21 million.\nNet tax balances of $227 million increased $66 million due to an increase in deferred tax assets associated with the provisions raised as a result of the BIG W network review.\nNet debt of $1,599 million increased by $377 million largely due to the timing of New Zealand creditor payments, higher net capital expenditure (excluding the proceeds from the sale of the Petrol business) and an increase in dividends paid during the year.\nNormalised Return on Funds Employed (ROFE) from continuing operations was 24.2%, 11 bps up on the prior year. Normalised AASB 16 estimated ROFE was 14.1%.\nCash flow from operating activities before interest and tax was $3,858 million, an increase of 0.5% on the prior year. Excluding the impact of significant items, higher EBITDA was offset by the impact of the New Zealand payment run in week 53 and a movement in provisions and accruals. The cash flow benefit from an extra week of trading is offset by nine months of EBITDA from the Petrol business compared to a full year in F18.\nThe cash realisation ratio was 74.1%. Excluding the timing of the New Zealand payment run, and charges associated with the BIG W network review and gain on sale of the Petrol business, the cash realisation ratio was 98.4%, impacted by the cash utilisation of provisions and accruals offset by trade working capital improvements.\nNet interest paid of $166 million declined by 9.8% compared to the prior year due to the early repayment of US Private Placement Notes in the prior year reducing average borrowing costs.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the EBIT for F19?", "output": "4.5", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table, the EBIT for F19 is 4.5%."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

We use a financial model that is aligned with our business strategy and includes a ROIC goal of 500 basis points over our weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\"), which we refer to as \"Economic Return.\" Our primary focus is on our Economic Return goal of 5.0%, which is designed to create shareholder value and generate sufficient cash to self-fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 12.0%. ROIC and Economic Return are non-GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC and Economic Return, are used for internal management goals and decision making because such measures provide management and investors additional insight into financial performance. In particular, we provide ROIC and Economic Return because we believe they offer insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view ROIC and Economic Return as important measures in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital requirements. We also use a derivative measure of ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation, and certain compensation incentives are based on Economic Return performance.\nWe define ROIC as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and other special items divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents. Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way. ROIC and other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nWe review our internal calculation of WACC annually. Our WACC was 9.0% for fiscal year 2019 and 9.5% for fiscal year 2018. By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders. Fiscal 2019 ROIC of 13.1% reflects an Economic Return of 4.1%, based on our weighted average cost of capital of 9.0%, and fiscal 2018 ROIC of 16.1% reflects an Economic Return of 6.6%, based on our weighted average cost of capital of 9.5% for that fiscal year.\nFor a reconciliation of ROIC, Economic Return and adjusted operating income (tax effected) to our financial statements that were prepared using GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.\nRefer to the table below, which includes the calculation of ROIC and Economic Return (dollars in millions) for the indicated periods:\nQuestion:\nWhat was the average invested capital in 2018?", "output": "735.6", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the table provided, the average invested capital in 2018 was $735.6 million."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

Revenue\nEffective September 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue Recognition (Topic 606). The new standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires the Company to recognize revenue in a manner which depicts the transfer of goods or services to its customers at an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nPrior to the adoption of the new standard, the Company recognized substantially all of its revenue from contracts with customers at a point in time, which was generally when the goods were shipped to or received by the customer, title and risk of ownership had passed, the price to the buyer was fixed or determinable and collectability was reasonably assured (net of estimated returns). Under the new standard, the Company recognizes revenue over time for the majority of its contracts with customers which results in revenue for those customers being recognized earlier than under the previous guidance. Revenue for all other contracts with customers continues to be recognized at a point in time, similar to recognition prior to the adoption of the standard.\nAdditionally, the new standard impacts the Company\u2019s accounting for certain fulfillment costs, which include upfront costs to prepare for manufacturing activities that are expected to be recovered. Under the new standard, such upfront costs are recognized as an asset and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of control of the products or services to which to the asset relates.\nThe following table presents the effect of the adoption of the new revenue guidance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2019 (in thousands):\n(1) Differences primarily relate to the timing of revenue recognition for over time customers and certain balance sheet reclassifications.\n(2) Differences primarily relate to the timing of recognition and recovery of fulfillment costs and certain balance sheet reclassifications.\n(3) Included within accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(4) Differences included in contract liabilities as of September 1, 2018.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the change in Prepaid expenses and other current assets due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09?", "output": "501573-514769 = -13196", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, the change in Prepaid expenses and other current assets due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 is:  $501,573 - $514,769 = $13,206  So, the change in Prepaid expenses and other current assets due to the adoption of ASU 2014-09 is $13,206."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

U.S. tax reform reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, assessed a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The impact on income taxes due to a change in legislation is required under the authoritative guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 740, Income Taxes, to be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. In conjunction, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) 118, which allowed for the recording of provisional amounts related to U.S. tax reform and subsequent adjustments related to U.S. tax reform during an up to one-year measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. The Company recorded what it believed to be reasonable estimates during the SAB 118 measurement period. During the December 2018 quarter, the Company finalized the accounting of the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform. Although the SAB 118 measurement period has ended, there may be some aspects of U.S. tax reform that remain subject to future regulations and/or notices which may further clarify certain provisions of U.S. tax reform. The Company may need to adjust its previously recorded amounts to reflect the recognition and measurement of its tax accounting positions in accordance with ASC 740; such adjustments could be material.\nThe computation of the one-time transition tax on accumulated unrepatriated foreign earnings was recorded on a provisional basis in the amount of $883.0 million in the fiscal year ended June 24, 2018, as permitted under SAB 118. The Company recorded a subsequent provisional adjustment of $36.6 million, as a result of incorporating new information into the estimate, in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended September 23, 2018. The Company finalized the computation of the transition tax liability during the December 2018 quarter. The final adjustment resulted in a tax benefit of $51.2 million, which was recorded in the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 23, 2018. The final balance of total transition tax is $868.4 million. The one-time transition tax is based on the Company\u2019s total post-1986 earnings and profits (\u201cE&P\u201d) that was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. The Company had previously accrued deferred taxes on a portion of this E&P. The Company has completed the calculation of total post-1986 E&P and related income tax pools for its foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of eight years.\nBeginning in fiscal year 2019, the Company is subject to the impact of the GILTI provision of U.S. tax reform. The GILTI provision imposes taxes on foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets. The Company has calculated the impact of the GILTI provision on current year earnings and has included the impact in the effective tax rate. The Company made an accounting policy election in the September 2018 quarter to record deferred taxes in relation to the GILTI provision, and recorded a provisional tax benefit of $48.0 million in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended September 23, 2018, under SAB 118. The Company finalized the computation of the accounting policy election during the December 2018 quarter. The final adjustment resulted in a tax expense of $0.4 million, which was recorded in the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the three months ended December 23, 2018. The final tax benefit of the election is $47.6 million.\nThe components of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the percentage change in the income before income taxes from Foreign countries from 2018 to 2019?", "output": "(2506447-3023599)/3023599 = -17.1", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can calculate the percentage change in income before income taxes from Foreign countries from 2018 to 2019 as follows:  Income before income taxes from Foreign countries in 2019 was $2,446,571, and in 2018 it was $3,023,599.

The estimated fair values of the core and developed technology and in-process research and development were determined based on the present value of the expected cash flows to be generated by the respective existing technology or future technology. The core and developed technology intangible assets are being amortized in a manner based on the expected cash flows used in the initial determination of fair value. In-process research and development is capitalized until such time as the related projects are completed or abandoned at which time the capitalized amounts will begin to be amortized or written off. Customer-related intangible assets consist of Atmel's contractual relationships and customer loyalty related to its distributor and end-customer relationships, and the fair values of the customerrelated intangibles were determined based on Atmel's projected revenues. An analysis of expected attrition and revenue growth for existing customers was prepared from Atmel's historical customer information. Customer relationships are being amortized in a manner based on the estimated cash flows associated with the existing customers and anticipated retention rates. Backlog relates to the value of orders not yet shipped by Atmel at the acquisition date, and the fair values were based on the estimated profit associated with those orders. Backlog related assets had a one year useful life and were being amortized on a straight\u00a0line basis over that period. The total weighted average amortization period of intangible assets acquired as a result of the Atmel transaction is 9 years. Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is not deductible for tax purposes.

The Company maintains a full valuation allowance against certain of its deferred tax assets consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards related to its foreign operations in Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America and Australia and net operating losses in the United States that are limited for use under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has combined net operating loss carry-forwards of $994.0 million.

Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code in the United States limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes, as defined by that section, occur. The Company has performed an analysis of its Section 382 ownership changes and has determined that the utilization of certain of its net operating loss carryforwards in the United States is limited based on the annual Section 382 limitation and remaining carryforward period. Of the net operating losses available at December 31, 2019 in the United States $38.4 million are limited for use under Section 382. Net operating loss carryforwards outside of the United States totaling $896.4 million are not subject to limitations similar to Section 382. The net operating loss carryforwards in the United States will expire, if unused, between 2025 and 2036. The net operating loss carry-forwards related to the Company's Mexican, Asian and Canadian operations will expire if unused, between 2020 and 2029.

As a result of applying the modified retrospective method to adopt the new standard, the following adjustments were made to noted accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 1, 2018:\nThe acceleration of revenue that was deferred under prior guidance as of the adoption date was primarily attributable to the requirement of Topic 606 to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract on a relative basis using SSP rather than allocating under the residual method, which allocates the entire arrangement discount to the delivered performance obligations.\nDue to the Company's full valuation allowance as of the adoption date, there is no tax impact associated with the adoption of Topic 606.\nWe made certain presentation changes to our Consolidated Balance Sheet on April 1, 2018 to comply with Topic 606.

The increase in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with prior year was primarily driven by higher transaction-related, severance and legal expenses, primarily related to the acquisitions of the EIS Business, Practice Fusion and Health Grid,\nwhich included higher (i) asset impairment charges of $58 million, (ii) goodwill impairment charges of $14 million, (iii) transaction-related, severance and legal expenses of $30 million, and (iv) amortization of intangible and acquisition-related asset of $9 million. The increase in amortization expense was primarily due to additional amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired as part of business acquisitions completed since the third quarter of 2017.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the change in Revenue between 2019 and 2017?", "output": "13346-(13383) = 26729", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table, the change in revenue between 2019 and 2017 is:  Revenue in 2019: $13,346 Revenue in 2017: $13,383  Therefore, the change in revenue between 2019 and 2017 is $0.007 billion, or 0.05%."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

Consequently, the carrying amount of goodwill was re-allocated among the reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment.\nIn conjunction with the changes mentioned above, the Company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a quantitative step one analysis, both before and after the changes were made, and determined that goodwill was not impaired.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company performed a qualitative analysis for all reporting units and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were in excess of the individual reporting units carrying values, and as a result, a quantitative step one analysis was not necessary.\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis on its reporting units. Based on the qualitative analysis performed during the Company's annual impairment evaluation for fiscal 2018 for certain of its reporting units, it was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were in excess of the individual reporting unit carrying values, and as a result, a quantitative step one analysis was not necessary.\nAdditionally, based on the results of the quantitative step one analysis for certain other of its reporting units, it was determined that the fair value was in excess of the individual reporting units carrying values. In fiscal 2017, the Company performed a quantitative analysis for all reporting units. It was determined that the fair values of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values.\nAs a result, no goodwill impairments were identified as part of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation for the periods mentioned above. During the year ended January 3, 2020 and December 28, 2018, the Company recorded an immaterial correction of $3 million and $6 million, respectively, with respect to fair value of assets and liabilities acquired from the IS&GS Transactions.\n(1) Carrying amount includes accumulated impairment losses of $369 million and $117 million within the Health and Civil segments, respectively.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the result of composition change of Defense solutions?", "output": "resulted in the identification of new operating segments and reporting units within Defense Solutions.", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, the composition change of Defense Solutions resulted in the identification of new operating segments and reporting units within Defense Solutions, and certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments.

Earnings from our foreign subsidiaries are currently deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We do not expect such reinvestment to affect our liquidity and capital resources, and we continually evaluate our liquidity needs and ability to meet global cash requirements as a part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Factors which affect our liquidity, capital resources and global capital deployment strategy include anticipated cash flows, the ability to repatriate cash in a tax efficient manner, funding requirements for operations and investment activities, acquisitions and divestitures and capital market conditions.\nIn summary, our cash flows were as follows (in thousands):\nNet Cash from Operating Activities\nIn 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $11.6 million, which was primarily due to a net loss of $15.4 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $4.3 million. Non-cash charges consisted primarily stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million and depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets and certain definite- lived intangible assets of $1.2 million. In addition, changes in working capital accounts used cash of $392,000 as a result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.5 million, partially offset by cash inflow from a decrease in inventory of $483,000, a decrease in accounts receivable of $218,000, a decrease in other assets of $229,000 and an increase in deferred revenue of $158,000.\nIn 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $12.6 million, and resulted primarily from a net loss of $13.8 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $3.6 million. These non-cash charges included write-downs of inventories in the amount of $386,000 to reflect excess quantities, depreciation and amortization of our long-lived assets of $1.3 million and stock-based compensation of $1.9 million. In addition, changes in working capital accounts used cash of $2.4 million as a result of an increase in accounts receivable of $1.3 million, an increase in gross inventory of $662,000, and an increase in other assets of $879,000, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $235,000 and an increase in trade payables of $223,000.\nIn 2017, net cash used in operating activities was $12.9 million, and resulted primarily from a net loss of $14.1 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $3.1 million. These non-cash charges included write-downs of inventories in the amount of $232,000 to reflect excess quantities, depreciation and amortization of our long-lived assets of $1.4 million and stock-based compensation of $1.4 million. In addition, changes in working capital accounts used cash of $1.9 million as a result of an increase in accounts receivable of $86,000, an increase in gross inventory of $1.8 million, and a decrease of accounts payable of $145,000, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $72,000.\nNet Cash from Investing Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $921,000, which was primarily attributable to the leasehold improvements and computer equipment at the new office premises of $576,000 and capitalization of internal use software of $365,000.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2018 was $288,000, primarily for capital expenditures to acquire manufacturing equipment and software, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of old equipment.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2017 was $642,000, primarily for capital expenditures to acquire manufacturing equipment and software.\nNet Cash from Financing Activities\nIn 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $7.6 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock in June 2019. These inflows were partially offset by scheduled repayments of finance lease obligations and tax payments related to net settlement of stock awards.\nIn 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $22.9 million, resulting from the additional borrowing of $9.0 million under the line of credit, net cash proceeds of $13.9 million from our common stock offering in May 2018 and proceeds of $676,000 from the issuance of common shares to employees under our equity plans. These proceeds were partially offset by scheduled payments of finance lease obligations and tax payments related to net settlement of stock awards.\nIn 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $15.2 million, resulting from the proceeds of $15.2 million from our stock offering in March 2017 and proceeds of $352,000 from the issuance of common shares to employees under our equity plans, net of taxes paid related to net settlement of equity awards of $198,000. These proceeds were partially offset by payments of $344,000 under the terms of our capital software lease obligations.\nWe require substantial cash to fund our business. However, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with available financial resources from the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months. OurRevolving Facility will expire in September 2021, and we expect to renew this line of credit or find an alternative lender prior to the expiration date. Further, any violations of debt covenants may restrict our access to any additional cash draws from the revolving line of credit, and may require our immediate repayment of the outstanding debt amounts. After the next twelve months, our cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our level of revenue and gross profit, the market acceptance of our existing and new products, the levels at which we maintain inventories and accounts receivable, costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity, new product development efforts, capital expenditures and the level of our operating expenses. In order to satisfy our longer term liquidity requirements, we may be required to raise additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that financing will be available at commercially acceptable terms or at all.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the value of the net cash used in investing activities in 2017 as a percentage of the net cash used in investing activities in 2019?", "output": "642/921  = 69.71", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can calculate the value of the net cash used in investing activities in 2017 as a percentage of the net cash used in investing activities in 2019.

Income Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d) was enacted into law. The Act made comprehensive changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carry-forwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 as well as the repeal of the current carryback provisions for net operating losses arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017; (3) immediate full expensing of certain qualified property; (4) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax; (6) repeal of the deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities; and (7) changes in the manner in which international operations are taxed in the U.S. including a mandatory one- time transition tax on the accumulated untaxed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. shareholders.\nIn response to the TCJA, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of TCJA. The purpose of SAB 118 was to address any uncertainty or diversity of view in applying ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes in the reporting period in which the TCJA was enacted. SAB 118 addresses situations where the accounting is incomplete for certain income tax effects of the TJCA upon issuance of a company\u2019s financial statements for the reporting period which include the enactment date. SAB 118 allows for a provisional amount to be recorded if it is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the TCJA. Additionally, SAB 118 allows for a measurement period to finalize the impacts of the TCJA, not to extend beyond one year from the date of enactment. For the year ended April 30, 2018, the Company recorded a provisional decrease in its deferred tax assets and liabilities for the reduction in the federal tax rate with a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance. During the year ended April 30, 2019, the Company completed the accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA with no material changes to the provisional estimate recorded in prior periods.\nThe TCJA also established the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) provisions that impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets on foreign corporations. The Company does not anticipate being subject to GILTI due to the sale of Gillam in Fiscal 2018 and the treatment of FEI-Asia as a disregarded entity for U.S. tax purposes.\nThe provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in thousands):\nQuestion:\nWhat is the average current provision for 2018 and 2019?", "output": "(303+(993))/2 = -345", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can calculate the average current provision for 2018 and 2019 as follows:  Average current provision for 2018 = ($993 + $1,200) / 2 = $1,097  Average current provision for 2019 = ($993 + $1,113) / 2 = $1,036  Therefore, the average current provision for 2018 and 2019 is $1,097 and $1,036, respectively."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

We considered the following: we have historical cumulative book income, as measured by the current and prior two years; we have strong, consistent taxpaying history; we have substantial U.S. federal income tax carryback potential; and we have substantial amounts of scheduled future reversals of taxable temporary differences from our deferred tax liabilities. We have concluded that this positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence and, thus, that the deferred tax assets as of March 29, 2019 are realizable on a \u2018\u2018more likely than not\u2019\u2019 basis.\nThe aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:\nThere was a change of $68 million in gross unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal 2019. This gross liability does not include offsetting tax benefits associated with the correlative effects of potential transfer pricing adjustments, interest deductions, and state income taxes.\nOf the total unrecognized tax benefits at March 29, 2019, $361 million, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate.\nWe recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. At March 29, 2019, before any tax benefits, we had $43 million of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. Interest included in our provision for income taxes was an expense of approximately $17 million for fiscal 2019. If the accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced in the period that such determination is made and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. Our most significant tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Ireland, and Singapore. Our tax filings remain subject to examination by applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings relate. Our fiscal years 2014 through 2019 remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes. Our fiscal years prior to 2014 have been settled and closed with the IRS. Our 2015 through 2019 fiscal years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes, and our 2014 through 2019 fiscal years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Singapore tax purposes.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. Although potential resolution of uncertain tax positions involves multiple tax periods and jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by $26 million. Depending on the nature of the settlement or expiration of statutes of limitations, we estimate $26 million could affect our income tax provision and therefore benefit the resulting effective tax rate.\nWe continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the change in gross unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal 2019?", "output": "$68 million", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the change in gross unrecognized tax benefits during fiscal 2019 was $68 million."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

We executed our annual event for the vast majority of customers on 1 April 2018 which included a like-for-like price increase.\n\u2014\u2014Stock: A small contraction in stock had a negative effect on ARPR growth of \u00a322 (2018: positive effect of \u00a320) and was -15% (2018: +13%) of total ARPR growth. A reduction in the number of new cars registered, lower volumes of preregistration and some consumer uncertainty led to a lack of used car supply in the market during the first half of the year. Retailer stock has seen some level of recovery through the second half of the year although the market is still challenging.\n\u2014\u2014Product: Our product lever contributed \u00a3121 (2018: \u00a386) and 81% (2018: 58%) of total ARPR growth. Our annual event allowed us to introduce two new products, stock exports and profile pages, into all package levels and we also monetised our Dealer Finance product following a trial period. Since 1 April 2018, over 5,000 retailers have opted to pay for the opportunity to advertise their finance offers against their cars, representing 70% of all eligible retailers. In addition, the penetration of our higher yielding Advanced and Premium advertising packages has continued to grow as retailers recognise the value of receiving greater prominence within our search listings. At the end of March, 19% of retailer cars advertised were on one of these levels (March 2018: 12%).

The financial assets account for 49.4% of the total assets. Receivables from affiliated companies amount to \u20ac8,214 million. This corresponds to 45.1% of the total assets. This position contains \u20ac6,117 million in receivables from a group-internal transfer of shares in affiliated companies at their carrying values and predominantly reflects the short-term financing requirements of the group companies as of the closing date.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the change in total assets in FY2019 from FY2018?", "output": "18221-17389 = 832", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the change in total assets in FY2019 from FY2018 is:  Total assets in FY2019 were \u20ac18,221 million, which is an increase of \u20ac1,008 million (or 5.6%) from the total assets of \u20ac17,213 million in FY2018.  This increase can be attributed to the following changes in the different categories of assets:  * Financial assets: There was an increase of \u20ac1,061 million (or 6.3%) in financial assets from \u20ac17,903 million in FY2018 to \u20ac18,964 million in FY2019. * Receivables from affiliated companies: There was an increase of \u20ac301 million (or 2.7%) in receivables from affiliated companies from \u20ac11,513 million in FY2018 to \u20ac11,814 million in FY2019. * Intangible assets: There was a decrease of \u20ac177 million (or 1.6%) in intangible assets from \u20ac1,008 million in FY2018 to \u20ac881 million in FY2019. * Tangible assets: There was a decrease of \u20ac2 million (or 0.1%) in tangible assets from \u20ac3 million in FY2018 to \u20ac1 million in FY2019. * Current assets: There was an increase of \u20ac553 million (or 4.5%) in current assets from \u20ac12,265 million in FY2018 to \u20ac12,818 million in FY2019.

The Company\u2019s significant deferred tax assets (liabilities) components are as follows:\nIn assessing the ability to realize the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets, management considers various factors including taxable income in carryback years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and future taxable income projections to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nBased on the negative evidence, including the worldwide cumulative losses that the Company has incurred, the Company has determined that the uncertainty regarding realizing its deferred tax assets is sufficient to warrant the need for a full valuation allowance against its worldwide net deferred tax assets.\nThe $4.3 million net increase in the valuation allowance from 2018 to 2019 is primarily due to operating losses incurred and windfall tax benefits on equity awards in the current year, partially offset by the reduction in valuation allowance as a result of recording a net deferred tax liability associated with the adoption of ASC 606. In addition, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $1.0 million for the release of a portion of the Company\u2019s pre-existing U.S. and U.K. valuation allowances as a result of the Ataata and Simply Migrate business combinations.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted in the United States. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118) that directed taxpayers to consider the impact of the U.S. legislation as \u201cprovisional\u201d when it did not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law.\nDuring 2019, the Company has completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act. During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company recognized an immaterial adjustment to the provisional estimate recorded related to the Act in the Company\u2019s fiscal 2018 financial statements.\nAs of March 31, 2019, the Company had U.K. net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $57.4 million that do not expire. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $78.6 million. U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through March 31, 2017 of approximately $32.5 million expire at various dates through 2037, and U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in the tax years beginning after March 31, 2017 of approximately $46.1 million do not expire.\nAs of March 31, 2019, the Company had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $54.6 million that expire at various dates through 2039. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had Australian net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $23.9 million that do not expire. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had German net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $9.9 million that do not expire.\nAs of March 31, 2019, the Company had Israeli net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3.3 million that do not expire. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had a U.K. income tax credit carryforward of $1.1 million that does not expire. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had Israeli income tax credit carryforwards of $0.6 million that expires in 2023 and 2024.\nUnder Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an ownership change occurs if there is a 50 percent cumulative change in ownership of the Company over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under U.S. state tax laws.\nThe Company believes that it has experienced an ownership change in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future resulting from future transactions in our share capital, some of which may be outside the Company\u2019s control. The Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income in the future may be subject to future limitations.\nAs of March 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $6.0 million and $6.2 million, respectively, none of which, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the tax benefit recognized by the company?", "output": "$1.0 million", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the tax benefit recognized by the company was $1.0 million for the release of a portion of the company's pre-existing U.S. and U.K. valuation allowances as a result of the Ataata and Simply Migrate business combinations.

All amounts set forth in the following tables are in millions, except per share data.\n(1) On January 1, 2018, we adopted a new revenue accounting standard utilizing the modified retrospective method of transition. As a result, periods prior to January 1, 2018 have not been restated to reflect the new accounting standard and continue to be reported under the accounting standards that were in effect for those periods.\n(2) Net income for 2019, 2018, and 2017 includes the impact of significant discrete tax-related impacts, including incremental income tax expense and benefits in 2017 and 2018 due to the application of the U.S. Tax Reform Act.

Leidos issues new shares upon the issuance of the vesting of stock units or exercising of stock options under these plans.\nIn fiscal 2017, stockholders approved the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan which provides the Company and its affiliates' employees, directors and consultants the opportunity to receive various types of stock-based compensation awards, such as stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based awards, as well as cash awards.\nThe Company grants service-based awards that generally vest or become exercisable 25% a year over four years or cliff vest in three years.

Prior to 2013, the Company offered an additional opportunity for deferrals into the Management Stock Compensation Plan (\"MSCP\"). Benefits from these plans are payable in shares of Leidos' stock that are held in a trust for the purpose of funding shares to the plans' participants.\nRestricted stock units deferred under the KESDP are counted against the total shares available for future issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan.

On June 17, 2018, Mr. Harizman exercised the aforementioned stock option on a net (cashless) exercise basis by delivering to us 181,936 shares of our common stock and he received 118,064 shares of our common stock.\nThe following table sets forth the compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to all persons who served as members of our board of directors (other than our Named Executive Officers) during the year ended December 31, 2019.

However, beginning in 2019, we altered our approach for these grants to replace the grant of restricted stock subject to time-based vesting with the grant of a combination of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") subject to time- based vesting and performance-based vesting. Each RSU represents the contingent right to receive a single share of our common stock upon the vesting of the award. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we granted an aggregate of 280,000 RSUs to certain employees. Of the RSUs granted during 2019, 217,000 of such RSUs are subject to time-based vesting and are scheduled to vest in three equal annual installments on the anniversary dates of the grant. The remaining 63,000 RSUs are performance-based awards that will vest based on our achievement of long-term performance goals, in particular, based on our levels of 2021 revenue and operating income. The 63,000 shares issuable upon vesting of the performance-based RSUs represent the maximum payout under our performance-based awards, based upon 150% of our target performance for 2021 revenue and operating income (the payout of such awards based on target performance for 2021 revenue and operating income would be 42,000 shares). In the case of the time-based and performance-based RSUs, vesting is also subject to the employee's continuous service with us through vesting. In 2018, we granted 280,000 shares of restricted stock to certain employees. Shares issued to employees vest in three equal annual installments on the anniversary dates of their grant. In 2019 and 2018, 194,333 and 182,500 shares of restricted stock vested, respectively.\nIn addition, in conjunction with our 2018 and 2019 Annual Meetings of Stockholders, we granted RSUs to certain members of our Board of Directors in respect of the annual equity compensation under our non-employee director compensation policy (other members of our Board of Directors elected to receive their annual equity compensation for Board service in the form of stock units under our Deferred Compensation Plan as described below). In 2019 and 2018, we granted 11,600 and 16,286, respectively, RSUs to members of our Board of Directors in respect of the annual equity compensation under our non-employee director compensation policy. RSUs issued to our Board of Directors vest at the earlier of the one-year anniversary of their grant or the next annual stockholders' meeting. In 2019 and 2018, 16,286 and 129,865 RSUs, respectively, vested.\nThe following table summarizes our aggregate restricted stock awards and RSU activity in 2019 and 2018:\nWe recognized $1.5 million and $0.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, which is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we will recognize $4.0 million over the remaining requisite service period for unamortized restricted stock, RSUs and stock options.\nUnamortized restricted stock and RSUs expense at December 31, 2019 that will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of 2 years totaled $1.2 million.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the number of unvested shares Granted in 2018 and 2019 respectively?", "output": "296,287, 291,600", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "multi-span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can answer the question as follows:  In 2018, the number of unvested shares granted was 280,000.

These software products are expected to satisfy the general release threshold within the next 12 months.\nSoftware development is also capitalized in accordance with ASC 350-40, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal - Use Software,\u201d and is amortized over the expected benefit period, which generally ranges from three to seven years. Long-lived assets are tested for impairment when events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable from future cash flows. Software costs capitalized during the years ended 2019 and 2018 were $4.1 million and $3.9 million, respectively.\nAnnual amortization charged to cost of sales when a product is available for general release to customers is computed using the greater of (a) the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, generally three to seven years or (b) the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product.

The revised blended approach includes the Company's weighted average historical and implied volatilities. The Company continued the use of this approach during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019.\nThe risk-free rate is derived using the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option on the grant date. During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, Leidos utilized the simplified method for the expected term, which represented an appropriate period of time that the options granted were expected to remain outstanding between the weighted-average vesting period and end of the respective contractual term.\nUpon re-examining the Company's exercise history, the methodology used to calculate the expected term changed in fiscal 2019. Based on actual historical settlement data, the midpoint scenario is utilized with a one-year grant date filter assumption for outstanding options. The Company uses historical data to estimate forfeitures and was derived in the same manner as in the prior years presented.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value and assumptions used to determine fair value of stock options granted for the periods presented were as follows:\nQuestion:\nWhat was the average Expected volatility in 2018 and 2017?", "output": "(26.6 + 29.7) / 2 = 28.15", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, the average Expected volatility in 2018 and 2017 is:  2018: 24.3% 2017: 26.6%  These values are based on the assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock options granted during each year, as described in the paragraphs."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

In addition, changes in working capital accounts used cash of $1.9 million as a result of an increase in accounts receivable of $86,000, an increase in gross inventory of $1.8 million, and a decrease of accounts payable of $145,000, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $72,000.\nNet Cash from Investing Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $921,000, which was primarily attributable to the leasehold improvements and computer equipment at the new office premises of $576,000 and capitalization of internal use software of $365,000.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2018 was $288,000, primarily for capital expenditures to acquire manufacturing equipment and software, which was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of old equipment.\nNet cash used for investing activities in 2017 was $642,000, primarily for capital expenditures to acquire manufacturing equipment and software.\nNet Cash from Financing Activities\nIn 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $7.6 million, primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock in June 2019. These inflows were partially offset by scheduled repayments of finance lease obligations and tax payments related to net settlement of stock awards.\nIn 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $22.9 million, resulting from the additional borrowing of $9.0 million under the line of credit, net cash proceeds of $13.9 million from our common stock offering in May 2018 and proceeds of $676,000 from the issuance of common shares to employees under our equity plans. These proceeds were partially offset by scheduled payments of finance lease obligations and tax payments related to net settlement of stock awards.\nIn 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $15.2 million, resulting from the proceeds of $15.2 million from our stock offering in March 2017 and proceeds of $352,000 from the issuance of common shares to employees under our equity plans, net of taxes paid related to net settlement of equity awards of $198,000. These proceeds were partially offset by payments of $344,000 under the terms of our capital software lease obligations.\nWe require substantial cash to fund our business. However, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with available financial resources from the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to satisfy our operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months. OurRevolving Facility will expire in September 2021, and we expect to renew this line of credit or find an alternative lender prior to the expiration date. Further, any violations of debt covenants may restrict our access to any additional cash draws from the revolving line of credit, and may require our immediate repayment of the outstanding debt amounts. After the next twelve months, our cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our level of revenue and gross profit, the market acceptance of our existing and new products, the levels at which we maintain inventories and accounts receivable, costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity, new product development efforts, capital expenditures and the level of our operating expenses. In order to satisfy our longer term liquidity requirements, we may be required to raise additional equity or debt financing. There can be no assurance that financing will be available at commercially acceptable terms or at all.\nQuestion:\nWhat are the respective net cash used in investing activities in 2017 and 2018?", "output": "642, 288", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "multi-span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the net cash used in investing activities in 2017 was $1,802,000, and the net cash used in investing activities in 2018 was $642,000."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

With Sigma contributing $5.0 million of revenue in June (the first month since acquisition), revenues for the remainder of Hansen excluding Sigma were $4.5 million lower. This decline was a result of lower non-recurring revenues, due primarily to both lower one-off licence fees and reduced project work following the large body of work completed in the first half of FY18 associated with implementing Power of Choice in Australia. Conversely, recurring revenues grew to represent 63% of total operating revenue.\nUnderlying EBITDA for the year was $55.8 million, 7.0% down on the $60.0 million in FY18.

This was principally due to a decrease of:\n\u2022 $90.4 million in revenue as a result of lower utilization, higher number of drydocking days and lower charterhire rates for our fleet for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the majority of our fleet was scheduled for drydocking, resulting in 278 days of off-hire in aggregate, compared to 28 days of off-hire during the same period in 2018; and\n\u2022 $2.3 million decrease in vessel and other management fees revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, mainly due to the wind down of OneLNG during 2018.\nThis was partially offset by the:\n\u2022 $20.4 million increase in revenue from the Golar Viking as she was mostly on-hire during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to being on commercial waiting time until December 2018.\nAverage daily TCE: As a result of lower voyage expenses offsetting the decrease in operating revenues, the average daily TCE for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased marginally to $44,400 compared to $43,700 for the same period in 2018.\nVessel operating expenses: Vessel operating expenses decreased by $2.9 million to $67.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $70.5 million for the same period in 2018, primarily due to a decrease of:\n\u2022 $3.1 million in reactivation and operating costs of the Golar Viking as she was taken out of lay-up in January 2018;\n\u2022 $1.8 million in expenses in relation to the Gandria as a result of the generic works in anticipation of her conversion into a FLNG at the start of 2018; and\n\u2022 $1.1 million in expenses in relation to the Gimi in the year ended December 31, 2019, as we commenced capitalization of costs associated with her conversion to a FLNG following receipt of the Limited Notice to Proceed in December 2018 to service the Gimi GTA Project.\nThis was partially offset by an increase in non-capitalizable vessel operating costs of $2.8 million net increase as a result of the scheduled drydocking in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nVoyage, charterhire and commission expenses: Largely relates to charterhire expenses, fuel costs associated with commercial waiting time and vessel positioning costs. While a vessel is on-hire, fuel costs are typically paid by the charterer, whereas during periods of commercial waiting time, fuel costs are paid by us. The decrease in voyage, charterhire and commission expenses of $66.1 million to $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $104.5 million for the same period in 2018, is principally due to a decrease of:\n\u2022 $56.4 million reduction in voyage expenses as a result of decreased utilization of our vessels; and\n\u2022 $15.2 million reduction in bunker consumption as the majority of our fleet underwent drydocking for a total of 278 days in aggregate, compared to 28 days during the same period in 2018.\nThis was partially offset by the $4.6 million increase in costs in relation to the Golar Arctic, as she was mostly on commercial waiting time for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to full utilization during the same period in 2018.\nAdministrative expenses: Administrative expenses decreased by $0.9 million to $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $51.7 million for the same period in 2018, principally due to a decrease in corporate expenses and share options expenses.\nProject development expenses: Project development expenses decreased by $3.1 million to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $5.2 million for the same period in 2018, principally due to a decrease in non-capitalized project-related expenses comprising of legal, professional and consultancy costs.\nDepreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization decreased by $0.6 million to $64.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $65.5 million for the same period in 2018, principally due to a decrease of $0.9 million in Golar Viking depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, as a result of a $34.3 million impairment charge on the vessel and equipment recognized in March 2019.\nImpairment of long-term assets: Impairment of long-term assets increased by $42.1 million for the year ended December 31,\n2019 due to a:\n\u2022 $34.3 million impairment charge on vessel and equipment associated with our LNG carrier, the Golar Viking. In March 2019, we signed an agreement with LNG Hrvatska for the future sale of the Golar Viking once converted into an FSRU, following the completion of its current charter lease term. Although the sale is not expected to close until the fourth quarter of 2020, the transaction triggered an immediate impairment test. As the current carrying value of the vessel exceeds the price that a market participant would pay for the vessel at the measurement date, a non-cash impairment charge of $34.3 million was recognized. The fair value was based on average broker valuations as of the measurement date and represents the exit price in the principal LNG carrier sales market; and\n\u2022 $7.3 million impairment charge associated with our investment in OLT Offshore LNG Toscana S.P.A. (\"OLT-O\"). In May 2019, a major shareholder in OLT-O sold its shareholding which triggered an assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of our 2.6% investment in OLT-O. As the carrying value of our investment exceeded the representative fair value, we wrote off our investment.\nOther operating gains: Other operating gains comprised of:\n\u2022 $9.3 million and $50.7 million recovered in connection with the ongoing arbitration proceedings arising from the delays and the termination of the Golar Tundra time charter with a former charterer, for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount for the year ended December 31, 2019 represents the final payment to settle these proceedings; and\n\u2022 $4.0 million loss of hire insurance proceeds on the Golar Viking for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nQuestion:\nIn which years was the  average daily TCE recorded for?", "output": "2018, 2019", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "multi-span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, the average daily TCE was recorded for the following years:  * 2019: $44,400 * 2018: $43,700  So, the average daily TCE was recorded in both 2019 and 2018."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

The objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany and other cash transactions. We expect that significantly all of the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) associated with the cash flow hedge-designated instruments addressing foreign exchange risks will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next twelve months.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of \u20ac1,000 million to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain intercompany loans. Under the terms of these contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, we make interest payments in euros at 3.50% per annum and receive interest in U.S. dollars at a weighted-average rate of 5.33% per annum. Upon the maturity of these contracts in fiscal 2022, we will pay the notional value of the contracts in euros and receive U.S. dollars from our counterparties. In connection with the cross-currency swap contracts, both counterparties to each contract are required to provide cash collateral.\nAt fiscal year end 2019, these cross-currency swap contracts were in an asset position of $19 million and were recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The cross-currency swap contracts were in a liability position of $100 million and were recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fiscal year end 2018. At fiscal year end 2019 and 2018, collateral received from or paid to our counterparties approximated the derivative positions and was recorded in accrued and other current liabilities (when the contracts are in an asset position) or prepaid expenses and other current assets (when the contracts are in a liability position) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

These estimates are adjusted to actual percentages experienced at each reporting date. As such, the Group determines its revenue by estimating variable consideration and applying the constraint by utilising industry data and historical experience (refer to note 3.6 for further information).\nKey estimate: trail commission revenue\nThe method of revenue recognition for trail commission revenue requires Directors and management to make certain estimates and assumptions based on industry data and historical experience of the Group. Refer to note 3.4 for details on trail commission revenue.\nRecognition and measurement\nRevenue represents the variable consideration estimated at the point in time when the Group has essentially completed its contracted services and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\nUpfront fees\nWhen the Group refers a consumer to the product provider (and thereby satisfies its performance obligation), the Group is entitled to an upfront fee that is contingent upon the following events: (a) the referred sale becoming \u2018financial\u2019, which occurs upon new members joining a health fund, initiating a life insurance policy, obtaining general insurance products, mortgages, broadband or energy products via iSelect; and (b) whether a \u2018clawback\u2019 of the upfront fee is triggered. Upfront fees may trigger a \u2018clawback\u2019 of revenue in the event of early termination by customers as specified in individual product provider agreements. These contingencies are incorporated into the estimate of variable consideration (refer to key estimates).\nClick-through fees\nClick-through fees are recognised based on the contractual arrangement with the relevant product provider. This can occur at one of three points; either when an internet user clicks on a paying advertiser\u2019s link, submits an application or a submitted application is approved.\nAdvertising and subscription fees\nRevenue for contracted services, including advertising and subscription fees, are recognised based on the transaction price allocated to each key performance obligation. As a result, non-refundable revenue may be recognised across multiple periods until the performance obligation has been satisfied.\nTrail commission revenue\nTrail commissions are ongoing fees for customers referred to individual product providers or who have applied for mortgages via iSelect. Trail commission revenue represents commission earned calculated as a percentage of the value of the underlying policy relationship to the expected life and, in the case of mortgages, a proportion of the underlying value of the loan. The Group is entitled to receive trail commission without having to perform further services.

The increase was also due to an increase in costs necessary to support a greater number of merchants using our platform, resulting in an increase in: credit card fees for processing merchant billings, employee-related costs, amortization of technology related to enhancing our platform, payments to third-party partners for the registration of domain names, and payments to third-party theme developers. As a percentage of revenues, costs of subscription solutions decreased from 9.4% in 2018 to 8.1% in 2019 due to a decrease in third-party infrastructure and hosting costs and employee-related costs as a percentage of revenue in 2019.\nCost of subscription solutions increased $39.7 million, or 64.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.

The increase was primarily due to the increase in GMV facilitated through Shopify Payments, which resulted in higher payment processing and interchange fees. The increase was also due to higher amortization, largely related to the technology resulting from the 6RS acquisition, higher product costs associated with expanding our product offerings and higher credit card fees for processing merchant billings. Cost of merchant solutions as a percentage of revenues increased from 35.0% in 2018 to 37.0% in 2019, mainly as a result of Shopify Payments representing a larger percentage of total revenue.\nCost of merchant solutions increased $144.2 million, or 62.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.

The capital of the Group consists of equity, debt and a compound financial instrument. The Group aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.\nThe key metrics used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are net external debt, debt to assets ratio and interest cover. The Group\u2019s stated medium to long-term preference is for the debt to assets ratio to be within the 40\u201350 per cent range and interest cover to be greater than 1.60x. The debt to assets ratio has increased to 67.8 per cent in the year due to the deficit on property revaluation.

Software sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions' ability to help our customer meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by the ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third party solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as staff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven by new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases.\nSupport, Maintenance and Subscription Services: Technical software support, software maintenance and software subscription services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting these offerings while market demand for maintenance services and updates that enhance reliability, as well as the desire for flexibility in purchasing options, continue to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud.\nProfessional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions into both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and fast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules.

The Company also has foreign incentive deductions of approximately $24.5 million that do not expire.\nIn addition, the Company has $0.3 million of federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards that will be refundable in future years, due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act described below.\nThe Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred taxes are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the temporary differences reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred taxes to the amount it believes is more likely than not to be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence quarterly, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Based upon the Company's review of all positive and negative evidence, the Company released $51.2 million in valuation allowance against certain of its deferred tax assets in 2017. In 2018, the Company released an additional $11.3 million of its valuation allowance as a result of completing its analysis of the effects of the Tax Act. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on its state deferred taxes, certain of its federal deferred tax assets, and certain foreign deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where the Company has cumulative losses or otherwise is not expected to utilize certain tax attributes.

Sales in 2018 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on the New York New Fare Payment System contract, which was awarded in October 2017. Increased work on both development and service contracts, including work on new change orders in London also increased CTS sales for the year. Sales were also positively impacted in the U.K. and Australia due to the impact of exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in an increase in CTS sales of $12.4 million for 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the strengthening of the British Pound against the U.S. dollar.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles: Amortization of purchased intangibles included in the CTS operating results totaled $5.2 million in 2018 and $5.7 million in 2017.\nOperating Income: CTS operating income increased 52% in 2018 to $60.4 million compared to $39.8 million in 2017. For 2018, operating income was higher from increased volumes of system development work and services, including work on new projects and change orders, primarily in North America and the U.K. Operating income was also higher due to operational efficiencies and reductions in R&D spending. R&D expenses for CTS in 2017 included $6.4 million of system development expenses related to our anticipated contract with the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority that was awarded in early fiscal 2018; such expenses incurred in 2018 on this contract are classified as cost of sales. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 CTS implemented our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and as a result began depreciating the cost of certain capitalized software into its operating results. This resulted in a decrease in operating income of $4.2 million between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018.

This increase was partially offset by term license contracts with multi-year committed maintenance periods, where a greater portion of the contract value is allocated to maintenance.\nThe increase in maintenance revenue in 2019 was primarily due to the continued growth in the aggregate value of the installed base of our software and strong renewal rates in excess of 90%\nPerpetual license\nThe decrease in perpetual license revenue in 2019 reflects the shift in client preferences in favor of our subscription offerings, particularly cloud arrangements\nConsulting\nOur consulting revenue fluctuates depending upon the mix of new implementation projects we perform as compared to those performed by our enabled clients or led by our partners.

Our money market assets are valued using quoted prices in active markets.\nThe liability for the subsidiary unit awards relates to agreements established with employees of our subsidiaries for cash awards contingent upon the subsidiary companies meeting certain financial milestones such as revenue, working capital, EBITDA and EBITDA margin. We account for these subsidiary awards using fair value and establish liabilities for the future payment for the repurchase of subsidiary units under the terms of the agreements based on estimating revenue, working capital, EBITDA and EBITDA margin of the subsidiary units over the periods of the awards through the anticipated repurchase dates. We estimated the fair value of each liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The fair value of each liability is calculated with thousands of projected outcomes, the results of which are averaged and then discounted to estimate the present value. At each reporting date until the respective payment dates, we will remeasure these liabilities, using the same valuation approach based on the applicable subsidiary's revenue and future collection of financed customer receivables, the unobservable inputs, and we will record any changes in the employee's compensation expense. Some of the awards are subject to the employees' continued employment and therefore, recorded on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we settled $0.2 million of the liability related to the subsidiary unit awards. The remaining liability balances are included in either accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 13).\nThe contingent consideration liability consists of the potential earn-out payment related to our acquisition of 85% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of OpenEye on October 21, 2019. The earn-out payment is contingent on the satisfaction of certain calendar 2020 revenue targets and has a maximum potential payment of up to $11.0 million. We account for the contingent consideration using fair value and establish a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of revenue attributable to perpetual licenses and subscription licenses over the 2020 calendar year. We estimated the fair value of the liability by using a Monte Carlo simulation model for determining each of the projected measures by using an expected distribution of potential outcomes. The contingent consideration liability was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs, including the revenue volatility and the discount rate. At October 21, 2019, the fair value of the liability was $2.8 million. At each reporting date until the payment date in 2021, we will remeasure the liability, using the same valuation approach. Changes in the fair value resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the contingent consideration liability decreased $0.2 million to $2.6 million as compared to the initial liability recorded at the acquisition date, primarily due to a change to OpenEye's 2020 projected revenue. The unobservable inputs used in the valuation as of December 31, 2019 included a revenue volatility of 45% and a discount rate of 3%. Selecting another revenue volatility or discount rate within an acceptable range would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the contingent consideration liability.\nThe contingent consideration liability is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 (see Note 13).\nWe monitor the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value as follows:\nLevel 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3.

Our exposure to the spot tanker market has contributed significantly to fluctuations in operating cash flows historically as a result of highly cyclical spot tanker rates.\nIn addition, the production performance of certain of our FPSO units that operate under contracts with a production-based compensation component has contributed to fluctuations in operating cash flows. As the charter contracts of some of our FPSO units include incentives based on average annual oil prices, the changes in global oil prices during recent years have also impacted our operating cash flows.\nConsolidated net cash flow from operating activities increased to $383.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, from $182.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to a $127.2 million increase in income from operations mainly from operations (before depreciation, amortization, asset impairments, loss on sale of vessels and the amortization of in-process revenue contracts) of our businesses.\nFor further discussion of changes in income from vessel operations from our businesses, please read \u201cItem 5 \u2013 Operating and Financial Review and Prospects: Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2013 Recent Developments and Results of Operations.\u201d\nIn addition, there was a $9.9 million increase in cash flows from changes to non-cash working capital, a $23.6 million increase in dividends received from joint ventures, and a $17.1 million increase in direct financing lease payments received, which are presented as an operating cash inflow instead of an investing cash inflow after the adoption of ASU 2016-02 in 2019.\nFurthermore, interest expense, including realized losses on interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, decreased a net amount of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a decrease in realized losses on cross currency swaps. These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash outflows of $15.9 million in dry-dock expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018.\nFinancing Cash Flows\nThe Daughter Entities hold all of our liquefied gas carriers (Teekay LNG) and all of our conventional tanker assets (Teekay Tankers). Teekay LNG received $317.8 million of net proceeds from the sale-leaseback financing transactions for the Yamal Spirit and Torben Spirit for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $370.1 million from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed for the Magdala, Myrina and Megara for the same period in 2018.\nTeekay Tankers received $63.7 million from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed on two of its Suezmax tankers for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $241.3 million in the same period last year from the sale-leaseback financing transactions completed on eight Aframax tankers, one Suezmax tanker and one LR2 Product tanker.\nWe use our credit facilities to partially finance capital expenditures. Occasionally, we will use revolving credit facilities to finance these expenditures until longer-term financing is obtained, at which time we typically use all or a portion of the proceeds from the longer-term financings to prepay outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facilities. We actively manage the maturity profile of our outstanding financing arrangements.\nDuring 2019, we had a net cash outflow of $227.3 million relating primarily to prepayments of short-term and long-term debt, issuance costs and payments on maturity of cross currency swaps, net of proceeds from the issuances of short-term and long-term debt, compared to net cash inflow of $553.7 million in 2018. Scheduled repayments decreased by $438.1 million in 2019 compared to 2018.\nHistorically, the Daughter Entities have distributed operating cash flows to their owners in the form of distributions or dividends. There were no equity financing transactions from the Daughter Entities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Teekay LNG repurchased $25.7 million of common units in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTeekay Parent did not raise capital through equity financing transactions in December 31, 2019, compared to $103.7 million raised in 2018 from issuances of new equity to the public, thirdparty investors and two entities established by our founder (including Resolute, our largest shareholder). Cash dividends paid decreased by $16.6 million in 2019, as a result of the elimination of Teekay Parent's quarterly dividend on Teekay\u2019s common stock commencing with the quarter ended March 31, 2019.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nDuring 2019, we received $100 million from Brookfield for the sale of our remaining interests in Altera (please read \"Item 18 \u2013 Financial Statements: Note 4 \u2013 Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera\"). We incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $109.5 million primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments in Teekay LNG.\nTeekay LNG received proceeds of $11.5 million from the sale of the Alexander Spirit and contributed $72.4 million to its equity-accounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture and the Bahrain LNG Joint Venture. During 2019, Teekay Tankers received proceeds of $19.6 million related to the sale of one Suezmax tanker.\nDuring 2018, we incurred capital expenditures for vessels and equipment of $0.7 billion, primarily for capitalized vessel modifications and shipyard construction installment payments. Teekay Parent advanced $25.0 million to Altera in the form of a senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nTeekay LNG received proceeds of $54.4 million from the sale of Teekay LNG's 50% ownership interest in the Excelsior Joint Venture and $28.5 million from the sales of the European Spirit and African Spirit. Teekay LNG contributed $40.5 million to its equityaccounted joint ventures and loans to joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily to fund project expenditures in the Yamal LNG Joint Venture, the Bahrain LNG project, and the Pan Union Joint Venture, and for working capital requirements for the MALT Joint Venture.\nTeekay incurred a net $25.3 million cash outflow as a result of the 2017 Brookfield Transaction (please read \"Item 18 \u2013 Financial Statements: Note 4 \u2013 Deconsolidation and Sale of Altera\").\nQuestion:\nWhat is the increase/ (decrease) in Net operating cash flows from Year Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018?", "output": "383306-182135 = 201171", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table, the increase in Net operating cash flows from Year Ended December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2018 is $127.2 million, from $182.1 million to $383.3 million."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

Excluding acquisitions, sales increased 5.2%, driven by favourable pricing, mix and volume in meat protein and accelerated growth in plant protein of 23.6%.\nNet earnings for 2019 were $74.6 million ($0.60 per basic share) compared to $101.3 million ($0.81 per basic share) last year. Strong commercial performance and favourable resolution of income tax audits were more than offset by strategic investments in plant protein to drive top line growth and heightened volatility in hog prices. Net earnings were negatively impacted by $12.1 million due to non-cash fair value changes in biological assets and derivative contracts, which are excluded in the calculation of Adjusted Operating Earnings below.\nAdjusted Operating Earnings for 2019 were $145.4 million compared to $215.6 million last year, and Adjusted Earnings per Share for\n2019 were $0.68 compared to $1.22 last year due to similar factors as noted above.\nFor further discussion on key metrics and a discussion of results by operating segment, refer to the section titled Operating Review\nstarting on page 3 of this document.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the net earnings per worker in 2019?", "output": "74.6/13000 = 0.01", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can calculate the net earnings per worker in 2019 as follows:  Net Earnings in 2019 = $74.6 million Number of Workers (as per the table) = 13,000  Therefore, the net earnings per worker in 2019 is: Net Earnings per Worker = $74.6 million / 13,000 workers = $5.70 per worker  So, the net earnings per worker in 2019 was $5.70."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

Also included in the deferred tax assets are North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit and North Carolina Jobs Credits totaling $4.9 million, as well as Georgia Job Tax Credits totaling $2.6 million. The North Carolina Investing in Business Property Credit provides a 7% investment tax credit for property located in a North Carolina development area, the North Carolina Creating Jobs Credit provides a tax credit for increased employment in North Carolina, and the Georgia Job Tax Credit provides a tax credit for creation and retention of qualifying jobs in Georgia. It is management\u2019s opinion that the majority of the North Carolina and Georgia income tax credits will not be utilized before they expire, and a $5.6 million valuation allowance has been recorded as of October 31, 2019.

The effective tax rate for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was 11.1%, 3.4% and 50.9%, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d), making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Reform Act has significant direct and indirect implications for accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, \u201cAccounting for Income Taxes\u201d some of which could not be calculated with precision until further clarification and guidance was made available from tax authorities, regulatory bodies or the FASB. In light of this uncertainty, on December 22, 2017 the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (\u201cSAB\u201d) No. 118, \u201cIncome Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d to address uncertainty in the application of U.S. GAAP when the registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. In accordance with SAB 118, Teradyne recorded $186.0 million of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 which represented Teradyne\u2019s best estimate of the impact of the Tax Reform Act in accordance with Teradyne\u2019s understanding of the Tax Reform Act and available guidance as of that date. The $186.0 million was primarily composed of expense of $161.0 million related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, $33.6 million of expense related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, and a benefit of $10.3 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions. In accordance with the requirements of SAB 118, in the fourth quarter of 2018, Teradyne completed its analysis of the effect of the Tax Reform Act based on the application of the most recently available guidance as of December 31, 2018 and recorded $49.5 million of net income tax benefit. The net benefit consisted of $51.7 million of benefit resulting from a reduction in the estimate of the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and an expense of $2.2 million associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the change in U.S. Income before income taxes in 2019 from 2018?", "output": "192442-189691 = 2751", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the change in U.S. Income before income taxes in 2019 from 2018 is:  $192,442 - $189,691 = $2,751  Therefore, the change in U.S. Income before income taxes in 2019 from 2018 is $2.751 million."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

Adjusted net debt includes long-term debt, net debt derivative assets or liabilities, short-term borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents.\n1 Includes current and long-term portion of long-term debt before deferred transaction costs and discounts. See \u201cReconciliation of adjusted net debt\u201d in \u201cNon-GAAP Measures and Related Performance Measures\u201d for the calculation of this amount. 2 For purposes of calculating adjusted net debt and debt leverage ratio, we believe including debt derivatives valued without adjustment for credit risk is commonly used to evaluate debt leverage and for market valuation and transactional purposes.\n3 See \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d for more information. 4 Adjusted net debt and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures. These are not defined terms under IFRS and do not have standard meanings, so may not be a reliable way to compare us to other companies. See \u201cNon-GAAP Measures and Related Performance Measures\u201d for information about these measures, including how we calculate themand the debt leverage ratio inwhich they are used.\nAs a result of our adoption of IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019, we\nhave modified our definition of adjusted net debt such that it now includes the total of \u201ccurrent portion of lease liabilities\u201d and \u201clease liabilities\u201d. We believe adding total lease liabilities to adjusted net debt is appropriate as they reflect payments to which we are contractually committed and the related payments have been removed from our calculation of adjusted EBITDA due to the accounting change.\nIn addition, as at December 31, 2019, we held $1,831 million of\nmarketable securities in publicly traded companies (2018 \u2013 $1,051 million). Our adjusted net debt increased by $3,379 million from December 31, 2018 as a result of: \u2022 the inclusion of lease liabilities in the calculation, which had a balance of $1,725 million at year-end, as discussed above; and \u2022 a net increase in our outstanding long-term debt, in part due to the 600 MHz spectrum licences we acquired for $1,731 million this year; partially offset by \u2022 an increase in our net cash position.\nSee \u201cOverview of Financial Position\u201d for more information.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the increase/ (decrease) in Long-term debt from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019?", "output": "16130-14404 = 1726", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the table provided, the increase in long-term debt from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 is $1,731 million.

These awards generally have requisite service periods of three years. Under each such award, stock or cash (as applicable) is issued without direct cost to the employee. We estimate the fair value of the share units based upon the market price of our stock at the date of grant. Certain share unit grants do not provide for the payment of dividend equivalents to the participant during the requisite service period (the \"vesting period\"). For those grants, the value of the grants is reduced by the net present value of the foregone dividend equivalent payments.\nWe recognize compensation expense for share unit awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, accounting for forfeitures as they occur. All cash-settled restricted stock units are marked-to-market and presented within other current and noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The compensation expense for our stock-settled share unit awards totaled $23.9 million, $21.8 million, and $18.2 million for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, including discontinued operations of $1.4 million for fiscal 2017. The tax benefit related to the stock-settled share unit award compensation expense for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $6.0 million, $7.2 million, and $7.0 million, respectively.

Included in the compensation expense described above for fiscal 2019 is expense of $18.9 million for accelerated vesting of awards related to Pinnacle integration restructuring activities, net of the impact of marking-to-market these awards based on a lower market price of shares of Conagra Brands common stock. Approximately $36.3 million of the fair value of the replacement share unit awards granted to Pinnacle employees was attributable to pre-combination service and was included in the purchase price and established as a liability. Included in the expense for cash-settled share unit awards above is income of $6.7 million related to the mark-to-market of this liability. As of May 26, 2019, our liability for the replacement awards was $15.9 million, which includes post-combination service expense, the mark-to-market of the liability, and the impact of payouts since completing the Pinnacle acquisition. Post-combination expense of approximately $3.9 million, based on the market price of shares of Conagra Brands common stock as of May 26, 2019, is expected to be recognized related to the replacement awards over the remaining post-combination service period of approximately two years.\nThe following table summarizes the nonvested share units as of May 26, 2019 and changes during the fiscal year then ended:\nDuring fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we granted 0.9 million, 0.9 million, and 0.6 million stock-settled share units, respectively, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $35.43, $34.16, and $46.79 per share unit, respectively. During fiscal 2017, we granted 0.4 million cash-settled share units with a weighted average grant date fair value of $48.07 per share unit.

Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities and funded status. The investment portfolio primarily contains a diversified mix of equity and fixed-income investments. Other assets such as private equity are used modestly to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and asset/liability studies at regular intervals.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of our pension plan assets:\n(1) Comprised of common stocks of companies in various industries. The Pension Plan fund manager may shift investments from value to growth strategies or vice-versa, from small cap to large cap stocks or vice-versa, in order to meet the Pension Plan's investment objectives, which are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital without undue exposure to volatility, and protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power.\n(2) Comprised of investment grade short-term investment and money-market funds.\n(3) Comprised of partnerships that invest in various U.S. and international industries.\n(4) Comprised of long-term government bonds with a minimum maturity of 10 years and zero-coupon Treasury securities (\"Treasury Strips\") with maturities greater than 20 years.\n(5) Comprised predominately of investment grade U.S. corporate bonds with maturities greater than 10 years and U.S. high-yield corporate bonds; emerging market debt (local currency sovereign bonds, U.S. dollar-denominated sovereign bonds and U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds); and U.S. bank loans.\n(6) Comprised of investments in securities of U.S. and non-U.S. real estate investment trusts (REITs), real estate operating companies and other companies that are principally engaged in the real estate industry and of investments in global private direct commercial real estate. Investments can be redeemed immediately following the valuation date with a notice of at least fifteen business days before valuation.\n(7) Comprised of investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share practical expedient. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 820-10, these investments have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The 2006 Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2006. Options granted under the 2006 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and had a ten-year contractual term. The 2006 Plan was replaced in May 2015 by the ADTRAN, Inc. 2015 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d). Expiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 under the 2006 Plan range from 2020 to 2024.\nIn January 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the 2015 Plan, which authorized 7.7 million shares of common stock for issuance to certain employees and officers through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock. The 2015 Plan was adopted by stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2015. PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock granted under the 2015 Plan reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Plan by 2.5 shares of common stock for each share underlying the award. Options granted under the 2015 Plan typically become exercisable beginning after one year of continued employment, normally pursuant to a four-year vesting schedule beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and have a ten-year contractual term. Expiration dates of options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 under the 2015 Plan range from 2025 to 2026.\nOur stockholders approved the 2010 Directors Stock Plan (the \u201c2010 Directors Plan\u201d) in May 2010, under which 0.5 million shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance. This plan replaced the 2005 Directors Stock Option Plan. Under the 2010 Directors Plan, the Company may issue stock options, restricted stock and RSUs to our non-employee directors. Stock awards issued under the 2010 Directors Plan become vested in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. Options issued under the 2010 Directors Plan had a ten-year contractual term. All remaining options under the 2010 Directors Plan expired in 2019.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, PSUs, RSUs and restricted stock for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which was recognized as follows:\nQuestion:\nWhat was the change in research and development expense between 2018 and 2019?", "output": "2704-2748 = -44", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the table and paragraphs provided, we can calculate the change in research and development expense between 2018 and 2019 as follows:  Change in research and development expense = $2,704 - $2,748 = $44  Therefore, the change in research and development expense between 2018 and 2019 was $44."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

The annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization. The Company does not expect the limitation to result in a reduction in the total amount utilizable.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company establishes reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when the Company believes that certain positions might be challenged despite its belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $67.0 million and $41.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands):\nAt December 31, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $67.0 million, of which $31.9 million would affect the Company\u2019s effective tax rate if recognized. The Company does not have any tax positions as of December 31, 2019 for which it is reasonably possible the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the following 12 months. The Company\u2019s policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the Company has accrued $5.2 million and $3.1 million related to interest and penalties, respectively.\nThe material jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved for these jurisdictions. For the United States, the Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for fiscal 2015 to 2017. For state and non-U.S. tax returns, the Company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2014.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the percentage change of additions based on tax positions related to current year from 2018 to 2019?", "output": "(16517-11860)/11860 = 39.27", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can calculate the percentage change of additions based on tax positions related to the current year from 2018 to 2019 as follows:  Additions based on tax positions related to current year in 2019 = $16,517 Additions based on tax positions related to current year in 2018 = $11,860  Percentage change = ($16,517 - $11,860) / $11,860 = 41.6%  Therefore, the percentage change of additions based on tax positions related to the current year from 2018 to 2019 is 41.6%."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

Adjusted net debt includes long-term debt, net debt derivative assets or liabilities, short-term borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents.\n1 Includes current and long-term portion of long-term debt before deferred transaction costs and discounts. See \u201cReconciliation of adjusted net debt\u201d in \u201cNon-GAAP Measures and Related Performance Measures\u201d for the calculation of this amount. 2 For purposes of calculating adjusted net debt and debt leverage ratio, we believe including debt derivatives valued without adjustment for credit risk is commonly used to evaluate debt leverage and for market valuation and transactional purposes.\n3 See \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d for more information. 4 Adjusted net debt and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures and should not be considered substitutes or alternatives for GAAP measures. These are not defined terms under IFRS and do not have standard meanings, so may not be a reliable way to compare us to other companies. See \u201cNon-GAAP Measures and Related Performance Measures\u201d for information about these measures, including how we calculate themand the debt leverage ratio inwhich they are used.\nAs a result of our adoption of IFRS 16 effective January 1, 2019, we\nhave modified our definition of adjusted net debt such that it now includes the total of \u201ccurrent portion of lease liabilities\u201d and \u201clease liabilities\u201d. We believe adding total lease liabilities to adjusted net debt is appropriate as they reflect payments to which we are contractually committed and the related payments have been removed from our calculation of adjusted EBITDA due to the accounting change.\nIn addition, as at December 31, 2019, we held $1,831 million of\nmarketable securities in publicly traded companies (2018 \u2013 $1,051 million). Our adjusted net debt increased by $3,379 million from December 31, 2018 as a result of: \u2022 the inclusion of lease liabilities in the calculation, which had a balance of $1,725 million at year-end, as discussed above; and \u2022 a net increase in our outstanding long-term debt, in part due to the 600 MHz spectrum licences we acquired for $1,731 million this year; partially offset by \u2022 an increase in our net cash position.\nSee \u201cOverview of Financial Position\u201d for more information.\nQuestion:\nWhat is used for to conduct valuation-related analysis and make capital structure-related decisions?", "output": "We use adjusted net debt and debt leverage ratio to conduct valuation-related analysis and make capital structure-related decisions.", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, adjusted net debt and debt leverage ratio are used for conducting valuation-related analysis and making capital structure-related decisions.

Post employment benefits\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans for our employees. The Group\u2019s largest defined benefit scheme is in the UK. For further details see \u201cCritical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\u201d in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting policies\nFor defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position. Scheme liabilities are assessed using the projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value.\nActuarial gains and losses are taken to the statement of comprehensive income as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive income.\nOther movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the income statement, including the current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the income statement. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the Group\u2019s share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate\nThe Group\u2019s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.\nBackground\nAt 31 March 2019 the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group\u2019s pension plans are provided through both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees\u2019 length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement\nThe Group operates defined benefit schemes in Germany, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, the UK, the United States and the Group operates defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece and Turkey. Defined contribution pension schemes are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South\u00a0Africa, Spain and the UK.\nDefined benefit schemes\nThe Group\u2019s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that location. The Group\u2019s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution (\u2018DC\u2019) arrangements and/or State provision for future service.\nThe Group\u2019s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (\u2018Vodafone UK plan\u2019). Since June 2014 the plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (\u2018CWW Section\u2019). Both sections are closed to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in Germany and funded plans in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets of the schemes.\nThe main defined benefit schemes are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The boards of the pension schemes are required by legislation to act in the best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding objectives.\nThe Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (\u2018HMRC\u2019) and is subject to UK legislation and operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section.\nThe trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. On 19 October 2017, the 31 March 2016 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section of the Vodafone UK plan, which is used to judge the funding the Group needs to put into the scheme, was concluded.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the difference between 2019 average defined contribution schemes and 2019 average defined benefit schemes?", "output": "[(166+178)/2] - [(57+44)/2] = 121.5", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, the difference between the 2019 average defined contribution schemes and 2019 average defined benefit schemes can be calculated as follows:  Average defined contribution schemes in 2019:  * 2019 average amount charged to income statement: \u20ac223 million * 2019 average total amount charged to income statement: \u20ac212 million  Average defined benefit schemes in 2019:  * 2019 average amount charged to income statement: \u20ac57 million * 2019 average total amount charged to income statement: \u20ac222 million  Therefore, the difference between the 2019 average defined contribution schemes and 2019 average defined benefit schemes is:  \u20ac223 million - \u20ac57 million = \u20ac166 million  So, the difference between the two is \u20ac166 million."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

Cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $896 thousand were primarily due to $66 thousand increase in royalty receivable and $830 thousand decreases in both accrued interest and accrued expenses.

Inventories\nInventories consisted of the following:\nThe increase in live inventories is attributable to an increase in the quantity of live birds in inventory at the Company's Tyler, Texas facility as it increased production during fiscal 2019, as well as the value at which the Company's live poultry inventories of broilers are recorded. In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be lower in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, the Company values the broiler inventories on hand at cost and accumulates costs as the birds are grown to a marketable age subsequent to the balance sheet date. In periods where the Company estimates that the cost to grow live birds in inventory to a marketable age and then process and distribute those birds will be higher in the aggregate than the anticipated sales proceeds, the Company will make an adjustment to lower the value of live birds in inventory to the net realizable value. The significant judgments that management makes in order to assess the net realizable value of its broiler inventory include estimating future selling prices of finished products and the related cost of sales to complete. The Company recorded a charge of $2.8 million at October 31, 2019 and of $9.6 million at October 31, 2018 to reduce the values of live broiler inventories on hand at those dates from cost to net realizable value.\nThe increases in feed, eggs and other, processed poultry and packaging materials inventories are also attributable to an increase in the inventory volume at the Tyler, Texas facility.\nThe increase in prepared chicken inventory is attributable to the mix of the different finished products in inventory at October 31, 2019, as compared to October 31, 2018, as well as an increase in production volume at the Company's prepared chicken facility in Flowood, Mississippi. During fiscal 2019, the facility processed approximately 129.1 million pounds of prepared chicken products, as compared to approximately 107.6 million pounds during fiscal 2018.

Mix of finished products in inventory: The table shows that the inventory volume of prepared chicken increased by $7.5 million, or 12%, from $63.6 million in 2018 to $71.1 million in 2019. This suggests that the mix of finished products in inventory at October 31, 2019 was different from that at October 31, 2018, leading to an increase in prepared chicken inventory. 2. Increase in production volume: The paragraphs state that the Company's prepared chicken facility in Flowood, Mississippi processed approximately 129.1 million pounds of prepared chicken products in fiscal 2019, which is an increase of approximately 19% from the 107.6 million pounds processed in fiscal 2018. This increase in production volume resulted in a corresponding increase in inventory volume at October 31, 2019.

Such plans conform to local practice in terms of providing minimum benefits mandated by law, collective agreements or customary practice. The Company recognizes the aggregate amount of all overfunded plans as assets and the aggregate amount of all underfunded plans as liabilities in its financial statements.\nThe Company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is updated at least annually, taking into consideration its asset allocation, historical returns on similar types of assets and the current economic environment. For estimation purposes, the Company assumes its long-term asset mix will generally be consistent with the current mix. The Company determines its discount rates using highly rated corporate bond yields and government bond yields.\nBenefits under all of the Company's plans are valued utilizing the projected unit credit cost method. The Company's policy is to fund its defined benefit plans in accordance with local requirements and regulations. The funding is primarily driven by the Company's current assessment of the economic environment and projected benefit payments of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company's measurement date for determining its defined benefit obligations for all plans is December 31 of each year.\nThe Company recognizes actuarial gains and losses in the period the Company's annual pension plan actuarial valuations are prepared, which generally occurs during the fourth quarter of each year, or during any interim period where a revaluation is deemed necessary.\nThe following is a summary of the status of the Company's foreign defined benefit pension plans and the net periodic pension cost (dollars in millions):\nThe long term rate of return on plan assets was determined using the weighted-average method, which incorporates factors that include the historical inflation rates, interest rate yield curve and current market conditions.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the change in Interest cost from year ended December 31, 2018 to 2019?", "output": "5.0-4.7 = 0.3", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, the change in interest cost from year ended December 31, 2018 to 2019 is:  5.0 - 4.7 = 0.3  So, the interest cost decreased by $0.3 million from 2018 to 2019."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

Contract costs are classified as either current or non-current based on the duration of time remaining between the date of the consolidated balance sheets and the anticipated amortization date of the associated costs.\nThe current portion of contract costs as of July 31, 2019 in the amount of $7.0 million is included in prepaid and other current assets on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The non-current portion of contract costs as of July 31, 2019 in the amount of $23.4 million is included in other assets on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.

Deferred revenue that will be realized during the 12-month period following the date of the consolidated balance sheets is recorded as current, and the remaining deferred revenue is recorded as non-current.\nDuring the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $112.2 million related to the Company\u2019s deferred revenue balance as of August 1, 2018.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the amount of unbilled accounts receivables in 2019 post transfer of control?", "output": "$9.7 million", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, the amount of unbilled accounts receivable in 2019 after transferring control of a ten-year time-based software license is $9.7 million.

Business Segments\nWe primarily derive our revenues from sales of our proprietary software (either as a direct license sale or under a subscription delivery model), which also serves as the basis for our recurring service contracts for software support and maintenance and certain transaction-related services. In addition, we provide various other client services, including installation, and managed services such as outsourcing, private cloud hosting and revenue cycle management.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, we realigned our reporting structure as a result of the divestiture of our investment in Netsmart on December 31, 2018, the evolution of the healthcare IT industry and our increased focus on the payer and life sciences market. As a result, we changed the presentation of our reportable segments to Provider and Veradigm. The new Provider segment is comprised of our core integrated clinical software applications, financial management and patient engagement solutions targeted at clients across the entire continuum of care. The new Veradigm segment primarily focuses on the payer and life sciences market. These changes to our reportable segments had no impact on operating segments. The segment disclosures below for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 have been revised to our current presentation.\nWe sold all of our investment in Netsmart on December 31, 2018. Prior to the sale, Netsmart comprised a separate reportable segment, which due to its significance to our historical consolidated financial statements and results of operations, is reported as a discontinued operation as a result of the sale. In addition, the results of operations related to two of the product offerings acquired with the EIS Business (Horizon Clinicals and Series2000) are also presented throughout these financial statements as discontinued operations and are included within the Provider reportable segment, except for acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, which are included in \u201cUnallocated Amounts\u201d. Refer to Note 17, \u201cDiscontinued Operations.\u201d\nAs a result of the above changes, as of December 31, 2019, we had eight operating segments, which are aggregated into two reportable segments. The Provider reportable segment includes the Hospitals and Health Systems, Ambulatory, CarePort, FollowMyHealth\u00ae, EPSiTM, EIS-Classics and 2bPrecise strategic business units, each of which represents a separate operating segment. This reportable segment derives its revenue from the sale of integrated clinical software applications, financial management and patient engagement solutions, which primarily include EHR-related software, connectivity and coordinated care solutions, financial and practice management software, related installation, support and maintenance, outsourcing, private cloud hosting, revenue cycle management, training and electronic claims administration services. The Veradigm reportable segment is comprised of the Veradigm business unit, which represents a separate operating segment. This reportable segment provides data-driven clinical insights with actionable tools for clinical workflow, research, analytics and media. Its solutions, targeted at key healthcare stakeholders, help improve the quality, efficiency and value of healthcare delivery.\nOur Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) uses segment revenues, gross profit and income from operations as measures of performance and to make decisions about the allocation of resources. In determining these performance measures, we do not include in revenue the amortization of acquisition- related deferred revenue adjustments, which reflect the fair value adjustments to deferred revenue acquired in a business combination. We also exclude the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, non-recurring expenses and transaction-related costs, and non-cash asset impairment charges from the operating segment data provided to our CODM. Non-recurring expenses relate to certain severance, product consolidation, legal, consulting and other charges incurred in connection with activities that are considered one-time. Accordingly, these amounts are not included in our reportable segment results and are included in an \u201cUnallocated Amounts\u201d category within our segment disclosure. The \u201cUnallocated Amounts\u201d category also includes (i) corporate general and administrative expenses (including marketing expenses) and certain research and development expenses related to common solutions and resources that benefit all of our business units (refer to discussion above), all of which are centrally managed and (ii) revenue and the associated cost from the resale of certain ancillary products, primarily hardware.

The Company recorded a benefit of approximately $3.3 million resulting from the effect of a reduction in the deferred rate and the ability to offset indefinite lived deferred tax liabilities with certain deferred tax assets, recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, certain foreign and state tax effects including a benefit of $0.4 million related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences. At March 31, 2018, we had $198.7 million of a federal net operating loss carryforward that expires, if unused, in fiscal years 2031 to 2038.\nFor fiscal 2017, the effective tax rate was different than the statutory rate due primarily to the recognition of net operating losses as deferred tax assets, which were offset by increases in the valuation allowance, state taxes and other U.S. permanent book to tax differences.\nAlthough the timing and outcome of tax settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur in the range of zero to $0.1 million of tax and zero to $0.2 million of interest based on the outcome of tax examinations and as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations. We are routinely audited; due to the ongoing nature of current examinations in multiple jurisdictions, other changes could occur in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months which cannot be estimated at this time.\nBecause of our losses in prior periods, we have recorded a valuation allowance offsetting substantially all of our deferred tax assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated prior to Tax Act reform depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Because of our losses in prior periods, management believes that it is more-likely-than-not that we will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the average effective tax rate for 2017 and 2018?", "output": "-(28.0 + 2.1) / 2 = -15.05", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can calculate the average effective tax rate for 2017 and 2018 as follows:  2017:  * Effective tax rate = ($236) / $1,257 = (2.1%)  Average effective tax rate = ($2.1%) x 2 = (4.2%)  2018:  * Effective tax rate = ($3,487) / $1,443 = (24.0%)  Average effective tax rate = ($24.0%) x 2 = (48.0%)  Therefore, the average effective tax rate for 2017 and 2018 was (4.2%) and (48.0%), respectively."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

The result of this calculation, representing the total intrinsic value of the warrant, was divided by the average Teradyne stock price for the period.\nThe computation of diluted net income per common share for 2018 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock options to purchase approximately 0.1 million shares and restricted stock units to purchase approximately 0.5 million shares because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nThe computation of diluted net income per common share for 2017 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock options to purchase approximately 0.1 million shares because the effect would have been antidilutive.\nQuestion:\nIn which year were the Employee stock purchase rights the largest?", "output": "Because 36>27>13, the answer is: 2018.", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the largest number of Employee stock purchase rights was in 2017, with 13 shares.

However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.\nIn addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated.

Management assessed the efficiency of our operations and consolidated locations and personnel, among other things, where possible. As part of this restructuring plan, the Company announced plans to reduce its overall operating expenses, both in the U.S and internationally.\nIn February 2019, the Company announced the restructuring of certain of our workforce predominantly in Germany, which included the closure of our office location in Munich, Germany accompanied by relocation or severance benefits for the affected employees. We also offered voluntary early retirement to certain other employees, which was announced in March 2019.\nIn January 2018, the Company announced an early retirement incentive program for employees that met certain defined requirements.

The emphasis remained on effective resource allocation and careful cost management. The overall investment in product development was maintained, with continuing focus on high-growth, high-margin areas. Investment in the sales and marketing organisation was targeted on expanding our key account management programme to drive incremental business with our most valuable customers and developing routes to market for our new technologies to a broadening customer base. Administration costs in 2019 reflected an inflationary increase and higher corporate costs, primarily due to CEO transition.\nSegmentally, investment continued in Networks & Security, where we see the most near-term opportunities for growth, particularly in relation to 400G high-speed Ethernet and our Positioning business. A new General Manager joined Lifecycle Service Assurance in October and a review is in progress to evolve the business and optimise the organisational structure to expand the customer base and deliver on our growth agenda. Proactive cost management has once again been demonstrated within Connected Devices, where we have seen a decrease in legacy product revenue year-on-year.

Special Charges and Other, Net\nThe following table summarizes activity included in the \"special charges and other, net\" caption on the Company's consolidated statements of income (in millions):\nThe Company continuously evaluates its existing operations in an attempt to identify and realize cost savings opportunities and operational efficiencies. This same approach is applied to businesses that are acquired by the Company and often the operating models of acquired companies are not as efficient as the Company's operating model which enables the Company to realize significant savings and efficiencies. As a result, following an acquisition, the Company will from time to time incur restructuring expenses; however, the Company is often not able to estimate the timing or amount of such costs in advance of the period in which they occur. The primary reason for this is that the Company regularly reviews and evaluates each position, contract and expense against the Company's strategic objectives, long-term operating targets and other operational priorities. Decisions related to restructuring activities are made on a \"rolling basis\" during the course of the integration of an acquisition whereby department managers, executives and other leaders work together to evaluate each of these expenses and make recommendations. As a result of this approach, at the time of an acquisition, the Company is not able to estimate the future amount of expected employee separation or exit costs that it will incur in connection with its restructuring activities.\nThe Company's restructuring expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were related to the Company's most recent business acquisitions, and resulted from workforce, property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations. These expenses were for employee separation costs and intangible asset impairment charges. The impairment charges in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were primarily recognized as a result of writing off intangible assets purchased from Microsemi prior to the close of the acquisition and other intangible assets that were impaired as a result of changes in the combined product roadmaps after the acquisition that affected the use and life of the assets. Additional costs will be incurred in the future as additional synergies or operational efficiencies are identified in connection with the Microsemi transaction and other previous acquisitions. The Company is not able to estimate the amount of such future expenses at this time.\nDuring fiscal 2018, the Company incurred expenses including non-restructuring contract exit costs of $19.5 million for fees associated with transitioning from the public utility provider in Oregon to a lower cost direct access provider. The fee is paid monthly and will depend on the amount of actual energy consumed by the Company's wafer fabrication facility in Oregon over the next five years. In connection with the transition to a direct access provider, the Company signed a ten-year supply agreement to purchase monthly amounts of energy that are less than the current average usage and priced on a per mega watt hour published index rate in effect at those future dates. Also during fiscal 2018, the Company incurred $1.2 million of employee separation costs in connection with the acquisition of Atmel.\nThe Company's restructuring expenses during fiscal 2017 were related to the Company's acquisitions of Atmel and Micrel, and resulted from workforce, property and other operating expense rationalizations as well as combining product roadmaps and manufacturing operations. These expenses were for employee separation costs, contract exit costs, other operating expenses and intangible asset impairment losses. The impairment charges in fiscal 2017 were recognized as a result of changes in the combined product roadmaps after the acquisition of Atmel that affected the use and life of these assets. At March 31, 2017, these activities were substantially complete.\nAll of the Company's restructuring activities occurred in its semiconductor products segment. The Company incurred $115.2 million in costs since the start of fiscal 2016 in connection with employee separation activities, of which $65.3 million, $1.2 million and $39.1 million was incurred during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company could incur future expenses as additional synergies or operational efficiencies are identified. The Company is not able to estimate future expenses, if any, to be incurred in employee separation costs. The Company has incurred $40.8 million in costs in connection with contract exit activities since the start of fiscal 2016 which includes $4.7 million of income incurred for the year ended March 31, 2019 and $0.7 million and $44.1 million of costs incurred for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amounts recognized during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were primarily related to vacated lease liabilities. While the Company expects to incur further acquisition-related contract exit expenses, it is not able to estimate the amount at this time.\nIn the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company completed the sale of an asset it acquired as part of its acquisition of Micrel for proceeds of $10.0 million and the gain of $4.4 million is included in the gain on sale of assets in the above table.\nQuestion:\nWhich years does the table provide information for activity included in the \"special charges and other, net\" caption on the Company's consolidated statements of income?", "output": "2019, 2018, 2017", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "multi-span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table, the information provided in the \"special charges and other, net\" caption on the Company's consolidated statements of income is for the following years:  * 2019 * 2018 * 2017  So, the table provides information for the years 2019, 2018, and 2017."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis via an identified line. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as \"platform as a service\" (PaaS), \"software as a service\" (SaaS), cloud subscriptions and managed services.\nCost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues is comprised primarily of third party network usage fees, maintenance of in-house data hardware centers, technical support personnel-related costs, and some third party royalty costs.\nCloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $78.8 million or 9.5% during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 10.8% after factoring the impact of $10.8 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in Americas of $61.6 million, an increase in EMEA of $14.7 million, and an increase in Asia Pacific of $2.6 million.\nThe number of Cloud services deals greater than $1.0 million that closed during Fiscal 2019 was 46 deals, consistent with that in Fiscal 2018.\nCost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $19.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to the prior fiscal year, due to an increase in labour-related costs of approximately $19.1 million and an increase in third party network usage fees of $1.3 million. These were partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous costs of $0.6 million. The increase in labour-related costs was primarily due to increased headcount from recent acquisitions.\nOverall, the gross margin percentage on Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased to approximately 58% from approximately 56%.\nFor illustrative purposes only, had we accounted for revenues under proforma Topic 605, Cloud services and subscriptions revenues would have been $901.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2019, which would have been higher by approximately $72.5 million or 8.7% as compared to the prior fiscal year; and would have been up 10.1% after factoring the impact of $11.0 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change would have been attributable to an increase in Americas of $56.4 million, and an increase in EMEA of $12.4 million and an increase in Asia Pacific of $3.7 million.\nThe $6.4 million difference between cloud service and subscription revenues recognized under Topic 606 and those proforma Topic 605 cloud services and subscriptions revenues described above is primarily the result of timing differences on professional services related to cloud contracts, where under Topic 605, revenues would have been deferred over the estimated life of the contract, but under Topic 606 these revenues are recognized as services are performed.

The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows (amounts in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had gross tax credit carryforwards of $191 million for state purposes. The tax credit carryforwards are included in Deferred tax assets net of unrealized tax benefits that would apply upon the realization of uncertain tax positions. In addition, we had foreign NOL carryforwards of $32 million at December 31, 2019, attributed mainly to losses in France which can be carried forward indefinitely.\nWe evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. We record a valuation allowance for assets that do not meet the threshold of \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be realized in the future. To make that determination, we evaluate the likelihood of realization based on the weight of all positive and negative evidence available. As a result of the Closing Agreement, we received in 2018, we determined at that time that our remaining California research and development credit carryforwards (\u201cCA R&D Credit\u201d) no longer met the threshold of more likely than not to be realized in the future. As such, consistent with our position at December 31, 2018, we have established a full valuation allowance against our CA R&D Credit. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the valuation allowance related to our CA R&D Credit is $71 million. We will reassess this determination quarterly and record a tax benefit if and when future evidence allows for a partial or full release of this valuation allowance.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we no longer consider the available cash balances related to undistributed earnings held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the amount of gross tax credit carryforwards for state purposes in 2019?", "output": "$191 million", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table, the amount of gross tax credit carryforwards for state purposes in 2019 was $191 million."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

We also offer quality products such as breakfast sandwiches with freshly cracked eggs, and craveable favorites such as tacos and curly fries, along with specialty sandwiches, salads, and real ice cream shakes, among other items. We allow our guests to customize their meals to their tastes and order any product when they want it, including breakfast items any time of day (or night). We are known for variety and innovation, which has led to the development of four strong dayparts: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night.\nThe Jack in the Box restaurant chain was the first major hamburger chain to develop and expand the concept of drive-thru restaurants. In addition to drive-thru windows, most of our restaurants have seating capacities ranging from 20 to 100 people and are open 18-24 hours a day. Drive-thru sales currently account for approximately 70% of sales at company-operated restaurants. The average check in fiscal year2019 was $8.34 for company-operated restaurants.\nWith a presence in only 21 states and one territory, we believe Jack in the Box is a brand with significant growth opportunities. In fiscal 2019, franchisees continued to expand in existing markets.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the number of company-operated and franchise restaurants over the past five years:\nSite selections for all new company-operated restaurants are made after an economic analysis and a review of demographic data and other information relating to population density, traffic, competition, restaurant visibility and access, available parking, surrounding businesses, and opportunities for market penetration. Restaurants developed by franchisees are built to brand specifications on sites we have approved.\nOur company-operated restaurants have multiple restaurant models with different seating capacities to improve our flexibility in selecting locations. Management believes that this flexibility enables the Company to match the restaurant configuration with the specific economic, demographic, geographic, or physical characteristics of a particular site.\nTypical costs to develop a traditional restaurant, excluding the land value, range from approximately$1.4 million to $2.0 million. The majority of our corporate restaurants are constructed on leased land or on land that we purchase and subsequently sell, along with the improvements, in sale and leaseback transactions. Upon completion of a sale and leaseback transaction, the Company\u2019s initial cash investment is reduced to the cost of equipment, which ranges from approximately $0.4 million to $0.5 million.\nQuestion:\nWhat percentage of sales at company-operated restaurants are from drive-thru sales?", "output": "approximately 70%", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table, drive-thru sales account for approximately 70% of sales at company-operated restaurants.

On a net effective basis (net of rent frees and incentives), rents were also 1 per cent ahead of previous rents. The upside from these new lettings added to like-for-like net rental income but was lower in magnitude than the negative impacts from administrations and CVAs and increased vacancy (see financial review on pages 30 to 37).\nOur customers continue to focus on increasing their space in prime, high footfall retail and leisure destinations. Significant activity in 2019 included:\n\u2014pureplay online brands starting to open stores to increase their physical presence. Morphe, the digital native cosmetics brand, opened three of its six UK stores at intu Victoria Centre, intu Eldon Square and Manchester Arndale, and AliExpress, the consumer platform of Alibaba, opened its first store in Europe at intu Xanad\u00fa\n\u2014Harrods taking its first shopping centre store, launching a new beauty concept, H Beauty, at intu Lakeside\n\u2014a new flagship store for Zara at St David\u2019s, Cardiff, where it is moving into the centre from the high street. This follows the recent upsizing of stores at intu Trafford Centre and intu Lakeside\n\u2014leisure brands increasing their space with Puttshack to open its fourth venue at intu Watford, following its successful opening at intu Lakeside. Namco is expanding its range of attractions at intu Metrocentre with Clip \u2018n Climb and the first Angry Birds Adventure Golf in the UK and Rock Up is taking space at intu Lakeside\n\u2014international fashion brands continuing to expand in the UK with Spanish brand Mango due to open at intu Watford a\nB Investment by customers\nIn the year, 256 units opened or refitted in our centres (2018: 262 stores), representing around 8 per cent of our 3,300 units. Our customers have invested around \u00a3125 million in these stores, which we believe is a significant demonstration of their long-term commitment to our centres.\nC Rent reviews\nWe settled 159 rent reviews in 2019 for new rents totalling \u00a345 million, an average uplift of 6 per cent on the previous rents.\nD Occupancy\nOccupancy was 94.9 per cent, in line with June 2019 (95.1 per cent), but a reduction against 31 December 2018 (96.7 per cent), impacted by units closed in the first half of 2019 from tenants who went into administration or through a CVA process in 2018. This had a 3.7 per cent negative impact on like-for-like net rental income in 2019 from both rents foregone and increased void costs.\nE Weighted average unexpired lease term\nThe weighted average unexpired lease term was 6.3 years (31 December 2018: 7.2 years) illustrating the longevity of our income streams. The reduction against the prior year was primarily due to new lease terms on department stores that have been through a CVA or administration process.\nF Footfall\nFootfall in our centres increased by 0.3 per cent in the year. UK footfall was flat, significantly outperforming the Springboard footfall monitor for shopping centres which was down on average by 2.5 per cent. We believe this highlights the continued attraction of our compelling destinations against the wider market. In Spain, footfall was up by 3.5 per cent.\nG Retailer sales\nEstimated retailer sales in our UK centres, which totalled \u00a35.2 billion in 2019, were down 1.6 per cent, impacted by some larger space users who have had difficulties and been through CVAs and those brands who operate successful multichannel models where in-store sales figures take no account of the benefit of the store to online sales. This compares favourably to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), where non-food retailer sales in-store were down 3.1 per cent on average in 2019.\nThe ratio of rents to estimated sales for standard units remained stable in 2019 at 12.0 per cent. This does not take into account the benefit to the retailer of their multichannel business, such as click and collect.\nH Net promoter score\nOur net promoter score, a measure of visitor satisfaction, ran consistently high throughout 2019 averaging 75, an increase of 2 over 2018. Visitor satisfaction is paramount to a shopper\u2019s likelihood to visit, which in turn drives footfall and extended dwell time.\nI Gross value of community investment\nGross value added, the measure of the economic contribution of intu to the local communities in the UK, remained stable in the year at \u00a34.8 billion.\nJ Carbon emission intensity reduction\nAnnual reduction in carbon emission intensity has reduced in 2019. This is due to our continued focus on energy efficiency to reduce our overall energy demand each year, supported by the ongoing greening of the electricity grid as we become less reliant on coal and increase our renewable generation.\nOur 2020 target was to reduce carbon emission intensity by 50 per cent, against a 2010 baseline. We reached this target three years ahead of plan and at the end of 2019, our reduction total was 69 per cent.\nQuestion:\nWhat are the components of leasing activity?", "output": "number, new rent, new rent relative to previous passing rent", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "multi-span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the table and paragraphs provided, the components of leasing activity for intu are:  1.

Working capital was also impacted by a decline in accounts receivable of $13.1 million compared to December 31, 2018.\nOur most significant use of funds in 2020 is expected to be for: (i) interest payments on our indebtedness of between $125.0 million and $130.0 million and principal payments on debt of $18.4 million; and (ii) capital expenditures of between $195.0 million and $205.0 million.\nBased on available cash, we may utilize a portion of the dividend savings to reduce our longterm debt or repurchase additional amounts of our Senior Notes in the open market or in private transactions if such purchases can be made on economically favorable terms. In the future, our ability to use cash may be limited by our other expected uses of cash and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited by our existing and future debt agreements.\nWe believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash.\nAfter that, our ability to fund these expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations, performance and cash flow. Our ability to fund these expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe may be unable to access the cash flows of our subsidiaries since certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit or other borrowing agreements, or subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions, that restrict the payment of dividends or making intercompany loans and investments, and those subsidiaries are likely to continue to be subject to such restrictions and prohibitions for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition, future agreements that our subsidiaries may enter into governing the terms of indebtedness may restrict our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or advance cash in any other manner to us.\nTo the extent that our business plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate, we may require additional financing or require financing sooner than we currently anticipate. Sources of additional financing may include commercial bank borrowings, other strategic debt financing, sales of nonstrategic assets, vendor financing or the private\u00a0or public sales of equity and debt securities.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, that anticipated revenue growth will be realized, or that future borrowings or equity issuances will be available in amounts sufficient to provide adequate sources of cash to fund our expected uses of cash. Failure to obtain adequate financing, if necessary, could require us to significantly reduce our operations or level of capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the average working capital deficit for 2018 to 2019?", "output": "-(67429 + 85471) / 2 = -76450", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, the average working capital deficit for 2018 to 2019 was $(85,471) million."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

At September 29, 2019, we recorded a valuation allowance of$2.5 million related to losses and state tax credits, which decreased from the$3.6 million at September 30, 2018 primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on prior year net operating losses. We believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss and credit carry-forwards will not be realized and that all other deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income or alternative tax strategies.\nThe major jurisdictions in which the Company files income tax returns include the United States and states in which we operate that impose an income tax. The federal statutes of limitations have not expired for fiscal years 2016 and forward. The statutes of limitations for California and Texas, which constitute the Company\u2019s major state tax jurisdictions, have not expired for fiscal years 2015 and forward.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the net deferred tax assets in 2019?", "output": "$85,564", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the net deferred tax assets in 2019 were $85,564.

The impact of changes is disclosed in Note 1.6.\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether:\n\u2022 The contract involves the use of an identified asset \u2013 this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified.\n\u2022 The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use; and\n\u2022 The Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Group has this right when it has the decisionmaking rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. In rare cases where all the decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used are predetermined, the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset if either:\n\u2022 The Group has the right to operate the asset\n\u2022\u2022 The Group designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. For measurement and recognition of right-of-use assets, refer to Note 3.1.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:\n\u2022 Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n\u2022 variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n\u2022 amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and\n\u2022 the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group\u2019s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets\nThe Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of machinery that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets, including IT equipment. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the percentage change in the total lease liabilities from 2018 to 2019?", "output": "(9342-8533)/8533 = 9.48", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, the total lease liabilities for the Group increased by 17.6% from $8,533 in 2018 to $9,342 in 2019.

See Note 2 for further details.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017 introduces a number of changes to U.S. income tax law. Among other changes, the Tax Act (i) reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, (ii) enacts limitations regarding the deductibility of interest expense, (iii) modifies the provisions relating to the limitations on deductions for executive compensation of publicly traded corporations, (iv) imposes new limitations on the utilization of net operating loss arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, (v) repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax and provides for a refund of existing alternative minimum tax credits, and (vi) creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively.\nAs a result of the new U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21% contained within the Tax Act, the Group recorded non-cash charges of $16.9 million to tax expense and $16.9 million to equity to revalue the Group\u2019s U.S. net deferred tax assets during fiscal year 2018.\nIn June 2019 and December 2017, as a result of the Group\u2019s assessment of the realizability of its Australian and U.S. deferred tax assets, the Group recorded non-cash charges to tax expense of $54.7 million and $30.4 million, respectively, and $25.8 million to equity in December 2017 to reduce the carrying value of these assets. The assessment of the realizability of the Australian and U.S. deferred tax assets is based on all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, recent cumulative earnings or losses, expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, and the carry-forward periods available for the utilization of deferred tax assets. The Group will continue to assess and record any necessary changes to align its deferred tax assets to their realizable value.\nIn December 2017, the Group made changes to its corporate structure to include certain foreign subsidiaries in its U.S. consolidated tax group that resulted in the creation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, including a non-recognized deferred tax asset of $2.1 billion related to the fair market value of its intellectual property. The assets are included in the Group\u2019s quarterly assessment and are only recognized to the extent they are determined to be realizable.\nThe impact on the net deferred tax asset from business combinations of $19.1 million in fiscal year 2019 represents the net deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized as a result of the acquisition of OpsGenie. The Group acquired net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets of approximately $1.8 million from OpsGenie. The Group also recognized deferred tax liabilities of approximately $19.6 million primarily related to acquired intangibles from OpsGenie, the amortization of which will not be deductible from future taxable profits.\nQuestion:\nWhen was the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted?", "output": "December 22, 2017", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

There is a greater likelihood of not realizing the future tax benefits of these net operating losses and other deductible\ntemporary differences in Brazil, Israel, China, and Korea since these losses and other deductible temporary differences must be used to offset future taxable income of\nthose subsidiaries, which cannot be assured, and are not available to offset taxable income of other subsidiaries located in those countries. Accordingly, we have\nrecorded valuation allowances related to the net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. Valuation allowances decreased $(12,101), and increased $317 and $6,812\nduring the years ended March 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively, as a result of changes in the net operating losses of the subsidiaries or as a result of changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates in the countries mentioned above\nThe decrease in valuation allowance during the year ended March 31, 2017 was also due to the reversal of valuation allowances of $5,530 related to the future\nutilization of NOLs totaling $15,878 at a Japanese subsidiary.

Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs, which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for marketing, facilities and overhead costs. In addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and invest in our growth initiatives, which include acquisitions of products, technology and businesses.

The Credit Agreement replaced and terminated our $400.0 million Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The maturity date on the line of credit facility is December 2023. At January 31, 2019, Autodesk had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit. As of March 25, 2019, we have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8, \"Borrowing Arrangements,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on our covenant requirements. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants, we will not be able to draw on our credit facility.\nOn December 17, 2018, we also entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the \u201cTerm Loan Agreement\u201d) which provided for a delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million. On December 19, 2018, we borrowed a $500.0 million term loan under the Term Loan Agreement in connection with the acquisition of PlanGrid. See Part II, Item 8,Note 8, \"Borrowing Arrangements,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the Term Loan Agreement terms and Part II, Item 8, Note 6, \"Acquisitions\" for further discussion on the PlanGrid acquisition.\nIn addition to the term loan, as of January 31, 2019, we have $1.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding. See Part II, Item 8, Note 8, \"Borrowing Arrangements,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally. Our primary commercial banking relationship is with Citigroup and its global affiliates. In addition, Citibank N.A., an affiliate of Citigroup, is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our $650.0 million line of credit.\nLong-term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following: repayment of debt; common stock repurchases; the acquisition of businesses, software products, or technologies complementary to our business; and capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal-use software applications\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world, with substantial amounts held outside of the United States. As of January 31, 2019, approximately 52% of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs. There are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances, such as foreign exchange restrictions, foreign regulatory restrictions or adverse tax costs. The Tax Act includes a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and generally eliminates U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions in future periods. As a result, earnings in foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the U.S. with little to no incremental U.S. taxes. We regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed. We expect to meet our liquidity needs through a combination of current cash balances, ongoing cash flows, and external borrowings.\nCash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nOur revenue, earnings, cash flows, receivables, and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy. See Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d for further discussion.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $377.1 million for fiscal 2019 consisted of $371.8 million of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, net, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, offsetting our net loss of $80.8 million, and included $86.1 million of cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nThe primary working capital source of cash was an increase in deferred revenue from $1,955.1 million as of January 31, 2018, to $2,091.4 million as of January 31, 2019. The primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $710.4 million for fiscal 2019 and was primarily due to acquisitions, net of cash acquired and purchases of marketable securities.

Net revenue is generated from sales of radio-frequency, analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multi-market applications. A significant portion of our sales are to distributors, which then resell our products.\nCost of Net Revenue. Cost of net revenue includes the cost of finished silicon wafers processed by third-party foundries; costs associated with our outsourced packaging and assembly, test and shipping; costs of personnel, including stock-based compensation, and equipment associated with manufacturing support, logistics and quality assurance; amortization of acquired developed technology intangible assets and inventory step-ups to fair value; amortization of certain production mask costs; cost of production load boards and sockets; and an allocated portion of our occupancy costs.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense includes personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, new product engineering mask costs, prototype integrated circuit packaging and test costs, computer-aided design software license costs, intellectual property license costs, reference design development costs, development testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs.\nResearch and development activities include the design of new products, refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expense includes personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, third-party sales commissions, field application engineering support, travel costs, professional and consulting fees, legal fees, depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs. Impairment Losses. Impairment losses consist of charges resulting from the impairment of acquired intangible assets.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges consist of severance, lease and leasehold impairment charges, and other charges related to restructuring plans. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income (expense), net includes interest income, interest expense and other income (expense). Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances. Interest expense consists of interest accrued on debt. Other income (expense) generally consists of income (expense) generated from non-operating transactions.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit). We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes and the realizability of assets in future years.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated:\nQuestion:\nWhat are the Research and development expense?", "output": "personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, new product engineering mask costs, prototype integrated circuit packaging and test costs, computer-aided design software license costs, intellectual property license costs, reference design development costs, development testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs.", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the Research and Development (R&D) expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:  * R&D expense for 2019 was $31 million, which represents 31% of net revenue. * R&D expense for 2018 was $31 million, which represents 31% of net revenue.

The principal components of our current and non-current deferred taxes were as follows:\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) was signed into law. As a result of the Act, we recognized an estimated expense of $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which $9.2 million related to the writedown of deferred tax assets and $2.7 million related to tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings. We calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act in our 2017 year-end income tax provision in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed to finalize the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. Additional work to complete a more detailed analysis of historical foreign earnings, as well as the full impact relating to the write-down of deferred tax assets, was completed in the third quarter of 2018 and resulted in a tax benefit of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, non-current deferred taxes related to our investments and our defined benefit pension plan reflect deferred taxes on the net unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and deferred taxes on unrealized losses in our pension plan. The net change in non-current deferred taxes associated with these items, which resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $0.4 million and $2.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, was recorded as an adjustment to other comprehensive income (loss), presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThe Company continually reviews the adequacy of our valuation allowance and recognizes the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Due to our recent decrease in revenue and profitability for 2019, and all other positive and negative objective evidence considered as part of our analysis, our ability to consider other subjective evidence such as projections for future growth is limited when evaluating whether our deferred tax assets will be realized. As such, the Company was no longer able to conclude that it was more likely than not that our domestic deferred tax assets would be realized and a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets was established in the third quarter of 2019. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable may be adjusted in future periods in the event that sufficient evidence is present to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our domestic deferred tax assets will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had gross deferred tax assets totaling $56.2 million offset by a valuation allowance totaling $48.6 million. Of the valuation allowance, $42.8 million was established in the current year primarily related to our domestic deferred tax assets. The remaining $5.8 million established in prior periods related to state research and development credit carryforwards and foreign net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards where we lack sufficient activity to realize those deferred tax assets. The remaining $7.6 million in deferred tax assets that were not offset by a valuation allowance are located in various foreign jurisdictions where the Company believes it is more likely than not we will realize these deferred tax assets.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the deferred tax assets for Inventory in 2019?", "output": "$7,144", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table, the deferred tax assets for Inventory in 2019 was $7,144."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities.\nThe amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2019 and 2018. We use the specific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realized gains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017. The following table summarizes the components of our cash equivalents and marketable securities held, substantially all of which were classified as available-for-sale:\nAs of May 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 33% and 26%, respectively, of our marketable securities investments mature within one year and 67% and 74%, respectively, mature within one to four years. Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.\nRestricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2019 and 2018 and our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was nominal.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the amount of marketable investment securities that will mature within one year by 2020?", "output": "33%*17313 = 5713.29", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can calculate the amount of marketable investment securities that will mature within one year by 2020 as follows:  As of May 31, 2019, approximately 67% of the marketable securities investments mature within one to four years.

Stock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes the components of non-cash stock-based compensation expense (in thousands):\n2015 Equity Incentive Plan\nWe issue stock options pursuant to our 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan allows for the grant of stock options to employees and for the grant of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, or RSUs, performance-based stock awards, and other forms of equity compensation to our employees, directors and non-employee directors and consultants.\nIn June 2015, our board of directors adopted and our stockholders approved our 2015 Plan pursuant to which we initially reserved a total of 4,700,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the 2015 Plan, which included shares of our common stock previously reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2009 Plan. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 each year, for a period of not more than ten years, commencing on January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2024, by 5% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the board of directors. As a result of the adoption of the 2015 Plan, no further grants may be made under the 2009 Plan. As of December 31, 2019, 6,527,550 shares remained available for future grant under the 2015 Plan.\nStock Options\nStock options under the 2015 Plan have been granted at exercise prices based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options under the 2009 Plan were granted at exercise prices as determined by the board of directors to be the fair market value of our common stock. Our stock options generally vest over a five-year period and each option, if not exercised or forfeited, expires on the tenth anniversary of the grant date.\nCertain stock options granted under the 2015 Plan and previously granted under the 2009 Plan may be exercised before the options have vested. Unvested shares issued as a result of early exercise are subject to repurchase by us upon termination of employment or services at the original exercise price. The proceeds from the early exercise of stock options are initially recorded as a current liability and are reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in capital as the awards vest and our repurchase right lapses. There were 250 and 957 unvested shares of common stock outstanding subject to our right of repurchase as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We repurchased 27 and 107 of these unvested shares of common stock related to early exercised stock options in connection with employee terminations during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We recorded less than $0.1 million in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets for the proceeds from the early exercise of the unvested stock options as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe account for stock-based compensation options based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. We recognize stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method, net of actual forfeitures, in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche.\nWe value our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our stock options. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the \"simplified method.\" Under the \"simplified method,\" the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. We use the \"simplified method\" due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options. Beginning in November 2019, the expected volatility for options granted is based on historical volatilities of our stock over the estimated expected term of the stock options. The expected volatility for options granted prior to November 2019 was based on historical volatilities of our stock and publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected term of the stock options.\nThere were 186,500, 219,450 and 252,100 stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We declared and paid dividends in June 2015 in anticipation of our IPO, which we closed on July 1, 2015. Subsequent to the IPO, we do not expect to declare or pay dividends on a recurring basis. As such, we assume that the dividend rate is 0%.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the percentage change in the Total stock-based compensation expense between 2018 and 2019?", "output": "(20603-13429)/13429 = 53.42", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the table provided, the Total stock-based compensation expense for 2018 was $13,429, and the Total stock-based compensation expense for 2019 was $20,603, which represents an increase of $7,174 or 52% between the two years."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

The carrying value associated with the cash surrender value of these policies is recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nFor purposes of performing Step 1 of goodwill impairment testing, the Company uses certain nonrecurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fair value of each reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is based on a weighting of an income approach and a market approach. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis that uses estimates of cash flows discounted to present value using rates commensurate with the risks associated with those cash flows. Under the market approach, a market-based value is derived by relating multiples for earnings and cash flow measures for a group of comparable public companies to the same measure for each reporting unit to estimate fair value. The assumptions used by the Company to determine fair value of the reporting units are similar to those that would be used by market participants performing valuations.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the change in the fair value of Company-owned life insurance in 2019 from 2018?", "output": "17.9-16.4 = 1.5", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can calculate the change in the fair value of Company-owned life insurance in 2019 from 2018 as follows:  Fair Value of Company-owned Life Insurance in 2019: $17.9 Carrying Value of Company-owned Life Insurance in 2018: $16.4  Therefore, the change in the fair value of Company-owned life insurance in 2019 from 2018 is:  $17.9 - $16.4 = $1.5  So, the fair value of Company-owned life insurance increased by $1.5 in 2019 compared to 2018."}, {"instruction": "Please read the following table in Markdown format and related paragraphs, and then answer the question according to the table and paragraphs.

The common units were historically considered to be stock-based compensation with terms that required the awards to be classified as liabilities due to cash settlement features. The vested portion of the awards was reported as a liability and the fair value was re-measured at each reporting date until the date of settlement, with a corresponding charge (or credit) to stock-based compensation expense. On December 31, 2016, the CII common units became fully vested and as such there is no remaining unrecognized compensation cost associated with CII common units for any period subsequent to December 31, 2016.\nThe value of the CII common units was derived from the value of CII\u2019s investments in the Company and Onvoy, LLC and its subsidiaries (\u201cOVS\u201d), a company that provided voice and managed services which the Company spun off during the year ended June 30, 2014. As the value derived from each of these investments was separately determinable and there was a plan in place to distribute the value associated with the investment in Company shares separate from the value derived from OVS, the two components were accounted for separately. The OVS component of the CII awards was adjusted to fair value each reporting period. On December 31, 2015, CII entered into an agreement to sell OVS to a third party. The sale was completed in May 2016. Based on the sale price, the estimated fair value of OVS awards was increased, resulting in an increase to stock based compensation expense and corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital of $12.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.

See Note 9 \u201cDebt Obligations\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of our debt instruments.\nOn November 22, 2019, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.875% Convertible Senior Notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). Approximately $43.2 million of the net proceeds were used to repay all outstanding borrowings then outstanding under our ABL and we intend to use the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include future acquisitions.\nOn July 25, 2018, the holders of the $36.8 million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes that were issued in connection with our acquisition of Del Monte converted these notes and related accrued interest of $0.3 million into 1,246,272 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nOn June 29, 2018, we entered into an asset-based loan facility (\u201cABL\u201d) that increased our borrowing capacity from $75.0 million to $150.0 million. Additionally, we reduced the fixed-rate portion of interest charged on our senior secured term loan (\u201cTerm Loan\u201d) from 475 basis points to 350 basis points over Adjusted LIBOR as a result of repricings executed on December 14, 2017 and November 16, 2018.\nA portion of the interest rate charged on our Term Loan is currently based on LIBOR and, at our option, a component of the interest charged on the borrowings outstanding on our ABL, if any, may bear interest rates based on LIBOR. LIBOR has been the subject of reform and is expected to phase out by the end of fiscal 2021. The consequences of the discontinuation of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could impact the interest expense we incur on these debt instruments. We will negotiate alternatives to LIBOR with our lenders before LIBOR ceases to be a widely available reference rate.\nQuestion:\nWhat is the value of total convertible debt in fiscal year 2019?", "output": "$154,000", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "span", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "According to the table and paragraphs provided, the value of total convertible debt in fiscal year 2019 is $154,000.

The fair values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired are based upon preliminary valuations and the Company's estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (potentially up to one year from the acquisition date).\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the periods indicated:\nThe Company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment on October 31st each year, using a two-step quantitative assessment. Step one is the identification of potential impairment. This involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit, which the Company has determined to be the entity itself, with its carrying amount, including goodwill.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nThe Company determined there were no indications of impairment associated with goodwill. As a result,n o goodwill impairment was recognized as of October 31, 2019. In addition to its annual review, the Company performs a test of impairment when indicators of impairment are present. As of December 31, 2019, there were no indications of impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill balances.\nQuestion:\nWhat was the change in the Beginning balance from 2018 to 2019?", "output": "238330 - 237992 = 338", "table_type": "vertical", "task_type": "TQA", "answer_type": "arithmetic", "dataset": "TAT-QA", "llama2_output": "Based on the information provided in the table and paragraphs, we can calculate the change in the beginning balance of goodwill from 2018 to 2019 as follows:  Beginning balance of goodwill in 2018 = $237,992 Adjustments in 2018 = $338 Ending balance of goodwill in 2018 = $238,330  Therefore, the change in the beginning balance of goodwill from 2018 to 2019 is:  $238,330 - $237,992 = $338  So, the beginning balance of goodwill in 2019 increased by $338 compared to 2018."}]
